<p>As of May 24, 2014, the main 4 carriers in the US will allow texting with 911. That’s great, but I wondered what it would look like if smartphones could build on top of that idea.</p>
<p>I want design to do good and feel like a moment of crisis is an ideal spot to employ thoughtful design to ease a difficult situation. Plus, it’s fun to weave different technologies together. What follows are some initial thoughts and a prototype. I’d love to hear feedback on both.</p>
<h1 id="overview-and-goals">
  Overview and Goals
  <a class="anchor" href="#overview-and-goals">#</a>
</h1>
<p>I wanted to allow users to have an efficient way of engaging with emergency services when certain situations arise. Composing a text message could be time-consuming in a moment where every second counts; good design can make this easier.</p>
<p>It’s also worth considering various use cases. Someone may not be able (or in a place to) speak—the operating system should assist them in the best way possible. Think about a person who may have a physical impairment or may be in a situation where speaking could further endanger them.</p>
<p>Smartphones possess the ability to access user data, such as GPS-assisted location and contact information. Employing them along with the main types of emergency calls (fire, medical/accidents, crime) could speed the experience along greatly.</p>
<p>A portion of the device’s battery could be reserved for emergency use. During an emergency, this could suspend other applications or non-critical systems to maximize battery life.</p>
<p>This experience should fit within the standard experience and not create a new visual language or groundbreaking new user interface. It is worth noting that this experience would exist on multiple platforms (Android, Windows Phone, and Blackberry). Given the tools available (<a href="http://flinto.com/">Flinto</a> and <a href="http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch</a>!), it was easier to make it happen on iOS.</p>
<p>A person should be able to interact with emergency services in every way the operating system can create a text. This includes on the Lock Screen, the Messages app, and Siri. You’ll find more on that below.</p>
<p>It could also take advantage of the microphone during a text session if a user desires. They could initiate a one-way call without going into a call screen. This would be possible by working with a service like <a href="http://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a> to send and store this data. Collecting it could also be beneficial in a domestic violence situation. (Thanks to Ben Vandgrift for that idea.)</p>
<p>If a phone’s been connected to a vehicle’s collision sensors via Bluetooth, it could detect a crash and send a notice to emergency services in the event of an accident.</p>
<p>In the event that a message couldn’t be delivered, this application would continuously attempt delivery, rather than fail and ask the user to send it again.</p>

<p>Interaction via the Lock Screen. <a href="https://www.flinto.com/p/a624bb9c">Play with the prototype on Flinto</a>.</p>
<p><img src="How%20smartphones%20could%20improve%20texting%20emergency%20se%202502298a58d24c579dc830a4e82c4fac/11yhXebq17Hhn8IKuWN_9pw.gif" alt="How%20smartphones%20could%20improve%20texting%20emergency%20se%202502298a58d24c579dc830a4e82c4fac/11yhXebq17Hhn8IKuWN_9pw.gif" /></p>
<h2 id="1-lock-screen">
  <strong>1) Lock Screen</strong>
  <a class="anchor" href="#1-lock-screen">#</a>
</h2>
<p>A user will tap the Emergency option on the Lock Screen, bringing up the dial pad, where the user now has the option to select Text. If a user selects Text, they can select their type of emergency, which reduces the time it takes to compose a text. They may select from any and all of the options presented, including not selecting any at all. (This is one situation where we may not want to force a choice.)</p>
<p>Most types of 911 calls fall into the categories of needing firefighters, medics, police, and sometimes all 3. I’ve accounted for this in this experience.</p>
<p>The user’s information will be pre-filled in a text message, and it will include their name, phone number, and GPS-assisted current location. The user is sent to a customized SMS screen.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> It’s important that we protect a person’s privacy. In light of that, texting through the lock screen keeps all other message threads hidden. (Thanks to @sulgi for the reminder)</p>
<h2 id="2-messages">
  2) Messages
  <a class="anchor" href="#2-messages">#</a>
</h2>
<p>A user initiates a text to emergency services (in the US, it’s 911). The interface adapts slightly to highlight calling 911 and adds a toolbar to include various information such as the user’s GPS-assisted current location and contact information.</p>
<h2 id="3-siri">
  <strong>3) Siri</strong>
  <a class="anchor" href="#3-siri">#</a>
</h2>
<p>When a user engages Siri, perhaps by saying “Tell 911 that there’s been an accident here,” Siri will create the text, pre-fill it with the user’s name, phone number, and GPS-assisted current location. Then the user is sent to a customized SMS screen, the same as in Option 1.</p>

<p>I did this as an exercise to see how good design could make a tough situation easier and more efficient. Even if this goes nowhere (I hope it doesn’t!), it feels important for designers to consider applying their knowledge to other areas.</p>
<p>I’d appreciate feedback on how to improve this concept. It would be wonderful to see a smartphone experience implemented—I’d love to know how, or if, that could happen.</p>
