<p>For most of us, conflict is often something we try to avoid. Yet, truly embracing “healthy” conflict is your team’s secret to building great products.</p>

</h2>
<p>To build the best products and teams, it’s critical that you collaborate deeply with people both inside and outside your discipline to build a shared sense of ownership. This workshop focuses on building working agreements.</p>
<p>It identifies areas for you and your team to unlock the collaboration required to build top-tier products and break down silos you didn’t even know were there. Whether it’s someone who’s strongly-opinionated or extremely shy, you’ll learn how to engage both—and everyone in between—for a more meaningful collaboration.</p>
<ul>
<li>45 minute talk with Q&amp;A and one-on-one office hours afterwards</li>
<li>2 hour workshop with one-on-one office hours available afterwards</li>
