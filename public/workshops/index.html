<p>I offer customized workshops, both in-person or remote, and talks for your teams, too! Just <a href="https://www.joshuamauldin.com/contact">get in touch</a> and we can discuss what you need.</p>

<p>For most of us, conflict is often something we try to avoid. Yet, truly embracing “healthy” conflict is your team’s secret to building great products.</p>
<p>In this workshop, you how to leverage healthy conflict with practical, equitable, non-prescriptive methods, and craft the best possible version of your product, your team, and even yourself. Through exercises, worksheets, and facilitated discussion, you&rsquo;ll leave with tools you can put to use in your next hard conversation.</p>
<p>Available as:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 hour workshop with one-on-one office hours available afterwards (4+ people required)</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="magical-cross-functional-collaboration">

  <a class="anchor" href="#magical-cross-functional-collaboration">#</a>
</h3>
<p>To build the best products and teams, it’s critical that you collaborate deeply with people both inside and outside your discipline to build a shared sense of ownership. This workshop focuses on building working agreements.</p>
<p>It identifies areas for you and your team to unlock the collaboration required to build top-tier products and break down silos you didn’t even know were there. Whether it’s someone who’s strongly-opinionated or extremely shy, you’ll learn how to engage both—and everyone in between—for a more meaningful collaboration.</p>
<ul>
<li>45 minute talk with Q&amp;A and one-on-one office hours afterwards</li>
<li>2 hour workshop with one-on-one office hours available afterwards</li>
