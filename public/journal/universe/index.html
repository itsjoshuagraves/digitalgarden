</p>

<p>I’ve always been a deep and curious listener. It’s something I love about myself: the ability to just tune in and pick up on undercurrents and deeper issues.</p>
<p>I’ve also been through a lot lately, and I knew it was coming because I’d been listening. This past year has been full of chaos and intense transformations professionally, personally, spiritually. Some positive, many earth-shattering. One of those transformations was my marriage ending last year.</p>
<p>When it did, a friend said “brother, the universe is going to start talking to you. And it’ll weird you out, because it’s going to do some wild things. Absolutely crazy things. Listen well.” I had no idea just how right they were, or just how loud the universe would be talking to me.</p>
<p>I’d like to tell you some of them. Plainly, out of respect for you, me, and the insights I’ve received.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-started">
  How it started
  <a class="anchor" href="#how-it-started">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Things began with a whisper last year when the universe told me that I’d have to fight my editor to keep the integrity of my book intact. It came to pass. I did fight, and I won.</p>
<p>I was determined to listen deeper.</p>
<p>It told me next through a reading that this next season of life would be full of impossible goodbyes and joy. It has certainly been that, and on a level I couldn’t conceive, even with my huge imagination.</p>
<p>It told me, to the day, and <em>how</em> my marriage would end. It was right. Before that day, I had this confirmed through another reading, because I wondered how something so catastrophic was possible.</p>
<p>Within the span of 2 weeks, I lost my home, wife of 17 years, my dog, my cat, money, and my family in one fell of the axe. i feared for my future and more than once for my life. I’d never been so low.</p>
<p>Was this confirmation bias, you wonder? Hardly. When something I love is threatened, I fight for it. I fight hard and don’t go down easy. Here, I resolved to give it everything I had, and to do it so that I wouldn’t have one single regret. I achieved that, with the sole exception that I up giving more than I should have.</p>
<p>Neither villain nor victim, this didn’t happen to me for a particular reason. I was just me trying to be me. And that me was someone who chose himself when pushed and abused to do otherwise.</p>
<h2 id="its-not-all-bad">
  It’s not all bad
  <a class="anchor" href="#its-not-all-bad">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Yes, I’ve taken massive and deeply unfair hits, and have had to make choices while at crossroads that shattered me. Some where I wish I could have just broken my own legs and laid down in the road before having to make another.</p>
<p>I’ve seen some of what’s to come for myself and my life, and it’s what always comes after life’s great difficulties: joy, peace, stillness, strength, security.</p>
<p>For instance, it told me that justice was coming. First through a song randomly on a Saturday morning (The Garden, by He Is Legend), then through a tarot card I pulled the next day (Justice), and then the day after through opening a new book directly to the exact the page describing the card
I’d pulled. Even my level of anxiety found itself stilled.</p>
<p>It’s also led me to joy and lightness that I’ve never known. Because I listened to it, and to myself.</p>
<p>It told me months ago about a very important date in a dream. I never dream about numbers, and if they appear they’re always gibberish. This one? Written in clear, bold lettering with “birth” alongside it. I was with my ex when I had that dream, and thought it was about becoming a parent since we were having conversations about it. But when the day came, I found out what it was: the day my name change was officially, legally recognized. So it was a brith, of sorts. Forecast months in advance.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">
  What’s next
  <a class="anchor" href="#whats-next">#</a>
</h2>
<p>On more than one occasion, I’ve been tempted into bitterness and hopelessness. But every time, every single time, I hear a bit of good news from the universe like some sweet, far-off song making its way to my ears. It’s enough to fend off any bitter gremlins and keep my heart working, even if it’s in recovery.</p>
<p>That’s where I am now: I’m hearing about other events, people I know and care about, and happenings that seem impossible. Things that, if they do happen, would see me gladly walk through the abyss of this season again with a smile on my face.</p>
<p>I would love to see those things happen now, and wish with my whole heart that they’d make haste to get here. But they will only be revealed in time. I could be wrong and have lost my mind. But knowing what’s happened so far: I’m not, and I didn’t.</p>
<p>Anticipation and uncertainty are always 9/10 of the fun, anyway.</p>
