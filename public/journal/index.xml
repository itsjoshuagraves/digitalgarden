      <description>Sometimes I get stuck on making a decision. It can be evaluating something, coming to terms with an idea or concept, or just plain seeing through the muck. What follows is a mix of my thoughts and others’ wisdom that’s helped me.
To figure out if you really want something in life, give yourself permission to explore the alternative and say no. Live with it for a few weeks. See how it feels after that.</description>

      <description> Kindness and niceness are not the same thing. Kindness leads to honesty and flourishing whereas niceness leads to ruin. </description>

      <description>I have always liked spooky stuff, even as a kid I would watch tales from the crypt with my aunt (who narced on me for watching beavis and butthead, strangely enough). I’d read Goosebumps, Bruce Coville, and anything on classic monsters I could find at the library. My first big horror book was Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein and I read that in sixth grade.
But a constant fascination for me were skeletons and skulls.</description>

      <description>Focus, as someone who struggles with ADHD, is elusive. It’s easily blown to bits by the smallest thing. But it also lets me hyper focus, so it’s more of learning how to wield that power than it is saying “this is bad.”
I’m not going to give advice here, just share what worked for me.</description>

      <description>I’m trying to make sure I’m set up as well as I can be for my life in the future. I don’t know what it’ll look like. It might not be great. But it could be wonderful. I need to prepare myself to be adaptable either way.

      <description>In 2017/2018, I began to really think longer term. What this did was propel me into a director role, help me launch a book, and get a grip on my anxiety.
Guiding Principles # I provide my own validation by living according to my principles, it does not come from others I am unafraid of speaking up and challenging others I am not responsible for other people’s emotions I’m aware of what people are feeling but it doesn’t control me and I don’t take it personally I don’t let what others think control me or influence me I seek out wisdom and the building of a better self I understand the value of self care and prioritize it Job security is an illusion, any job can end at any time.</description>
