      <description>Sometimes I get stuck on making a decision. It can be evaluating something, coming to terms with an idea or concept, or just plain seeing through the muck. What follows is a mix of my thoughts and others’ wisdom that’s helped me.
To figure out if you really want something in life, give yourself permission to explore the alternative and say no. Live with it for a few weeks. See how it feels after that.</description>

      <description>I have always liked spooky stuff, even as a kid I would watch tales from the crypt with my aunt (who narced on me for watching beavis and butthead, strangely enough). I’d read Goosebumps, Bruce Coville, and anything on classic monsters I could find at the library. My first big horror book was Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein and I read that in sixth grade.
But a constant fascination for me were skeletons and skulls.</description>

      <description>Success criteria for apps and websites # As of writing, the goal is to follow WCAG 2.1, but falling back to WCAG 2.0 is acceptable. The following success criteria are below. This has been helpfully adapted by Kris Rivenburgh.
WCAG 2.0 AA # Section 1: Alternatives
Alt text (1.1.1): All images and non-text content needs alt text (there are exceptions) Video &amp;amp; Audio alternatives (1.2.1): All video-only and audio-only content has a text transcript.</description>

      <description>What does good collaboration look like? Some thoughts:
To Designers # Attend ceremonies with engineers Treat this like a user interview, you&amp;rsquo;re listening for where they may be getting confused Cross pair with Engineering and PM Get into their backlog or development environment how should cross pairing work? when and how often? what does each do? Bring them into your design file Ensure Engineers have validated and modular designs (with users, stakeholders, and Engineers) to build Do what you can to shorten the understanding gap, with examples: Engineering: learn HTML/CSS/JS, learn basic git PM: plan design work with your PM, co-create stories in your backlog Pair with other designers Designers get better at their craft when we learn by doing work with someone else.</description>

General guidance # Show in context # It’s always best to show something in context, and at the right fidelity. To that end:
Prefer to show something interactive over something static Prefer to show something in context (e.g. if it’s an app, show it on a phone. A site should be demoed in a browser.</description>

      <description>💡 The big idea here is to **stay quiet and listen** to the person. It&#39;s okay to add in clarifying questions (e.g. &#34;could you say more&#34; or &#34;what led you to that?&#34;), but otherwise let them take the lead.

      <description>Ethnographic interviews help us understand users in their own environment, the problems they face, and how they face them.
The main goal here is to listen and avoid injecting your own bias into the project. Let the person you&amp;rsquo;re interviewing speak much more than yourself.
Once you&amp;rsquo;re done, synthesize your insights and share them out with your client. Some good talking points:

Get a VPN to encrypt your browsing and data. I use Private Internet Access, it’s like $3/mo and covers all my devices Use Signal or other fully end to end encrypted calls, texts, and videos. Do not use regular SMS or phone calls, they can be tracked. FaceTime audio will do if no other option is available. Do not share whereabouts online, don’t send sensitive info via twitter and Instagram.</description>

We need more good feedback in our world, and I don’t just mean the type of feedback that celebrates your good work. I’m talking about feedback that is actionable, specific, and kind; feedback that does not set us on edge or make us fall into an anxious spiral; feedback that helps us collaborate more effectively. The kind of feedback that is actually really hard to do when working remotely.</description>

      <description>Focus, as someone who struggles with ADHD, is elusive. It’s easily blown to bits by the smallest thing. But it also lets me hyper focus, so it’s more of learning how to wield that power than it is saying “this is bad.”

I had a lot of good responses to a question I put out on LinkedIn about advice for product design portfolios so I thought I’d expound on that here in hopes of helping you get called in for an interview.
While the principles here are applicable to almost all types of design roles, I’m going to narrow the focus of this to folks who are seeking a product design role.</description>

      <description>Something I deeply believe is that if you’re able to have focused time to work, you’re going to be able to go further, faster, and deeper than those who don’t.
That’s been especially true for me in this time of quarantine. When this began, I was hyper-available to people, answering emails and chats much quicker than I would usually. That, paired with the uncertainty of this pandemic made for a huge drag on my focus and craft.</description>

      <description>Original post
I keep wondering what we can do to ensure we’re building a better world with the products we make and if we need a code of ethics. So often I see people fall through the cracks because they’re “edge cases” or “not the target audience.” But at the end of the day, we’re still talking about humans.
Other professions that can deeply alter someone’s life have a code of ethics and conduct they must adhere to.</description>

Remember the last time you couldn’t get something out of your head and you woke up thinking about it in the middle of the night? The last few weeks of quarantine have been one continuous stretch of undifferentiated time and it’s become hard to turn things off. So I’ll share what I did about it in hopes of it helping you too. After putting this self-care routine into practice, I’ve been much more effective and focused during the day.</description>

You’re going to say the technique I’m about to share is just a glorified way of manipulating someone. Hear me out though.
Not all conflict is easy to address. We’re by no means perfect. We put so much of ourselves into our work that it’s hard to not take some feedback personally.</description>

Here’s the most helpful thing I’ve ever learned by far about conflict: before you have a conversation with someone, make sure you assume positive intent. Read on to discover a technique you can use to apply that idea — if you’re like me, you’ll find it will resolve most conflict before it starts. And, in a fun plot twist, we’ll also cover how this idea shouldn’t be applied at all times because it can harm underrepresented folks if we aren’t careful.</description>

The Legend of Zelda
I played a lot of video games growing up. It all started with The Legend of Zelda. I had such bad allergies that most of my adventuring had to be more pixel-based than anything. I didn’t expect to learn all that time spent playing video games would amount to anything, especially when it came to conflict resolution. Turns out there’s a lot more in common with old school video games and modern day human behavior than you’d think.</description>

Black Mirror on Twitter
I want to have more ethical products. I feel like we all do. Sometimes, though, we don’t consider how this amazing thing we’re working on might have some unintended and negative consequences.
In my job, I help clients build products. Part of the process is framing the project and defining our goals. We also talk about anti-goals, which are things we absolutely don’t want to happen and run counter to our intentions.</description>

Virtual Reality Experience by Mooms from the Noun Project
I recently made my first VR app for a client who commissioned an app to celebrate their 100th anniversary. In it, you walk through a 3D art gallery complete with with audio and imagery to understand their history.
Having primarily designed for mobile over the last few years, this was a fun new medium to explore. The new constraints and considerations were interesting, too.</description>

Over the holiday, I did the unthinkable: turned off push notifications from Messages. Up to that point, I’d received a steadily-increasing stream of messages from co-workers and friends—my head was buzzing as much as my phone. It was hard to get any quiet time in my own head and I was tired of my tiny illuminated rectangle commanding my attention.
When I put a stop to it, I became more at peace.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m really fed up with notifications.
When it&amp;rsquo;s not the group chat blowing up, it&amp;rsquo;s a breaking news alert. When it&amp;rsquo;s not a reminder to meet your step goal, your budget app is letting you know you&amp;rsquo;ve spent too much at Starbucks this week.
Now, before you say anything, I know. I can just turn them off.
But I want certain notifications to get through. Texts from my Mom, for example.</description>

Push notifications are incredibly handy for giving you important information. Your flight being delayed? Really helpful to know. Getting a notification for everything one of the Avengers is posting about? Probably not.
Just like you’re going to ignore or shut down the person who continuously interrupts you, you’re more likely to do the same to an app that bothers you with trivial information.
Push notifications are interruptive and we must be careful in our use of them if we are to retain our customers’ happiness and trust.</description>

I have an idea about how to help people being harassed, and it’s about how people get and manage their replies.
This idea is more of an umbrella in a shitstorm. It’s a short-term solution that helps us stay dry while we try to get indoors to safety.
How we can filter replies # The core of this idea is that anyone could mention you, share or like your updates, but you don’t see every reply.</description>

I’ve had lots of conversations about typography over the last few years. Which is cool, because I love it so much (so much that I decided to make my own typeface). It’s exciting to see so many designers caring about making a beautiful group of letters that people want to read.
One common theme I see in these conversations is how to get the best readability with text. We usually end up talking about serif vs sans serif, line height, line spacing, and other tricks.</description>

Also, it’s fun to note that everything from this era is basically a clickbait style headline. Ugh. I’m always curious about how changing a habit will affect me and have little aversion to change.

I started with style guides like any other obsessive-compulsive designer: with the desire to make it simple to maintain and grow a design. Plus, knowing which component to use in a given situation is nice, too, right? Since making this a regular practice, I’ve found it’s been like having a nice combination of a CSS class and a pattern library all in one.
One of the first questions, understandably, is why use Fireworks for a style guide?</description>

      <description>Basquiat How&amp;rsquo;s this built? # I use Hugo, a static site generator. It&amp;rsquo;s working with Go, markdown, and powered by GitHub pages. There&amp;rsquo;s no fancy CMS, no loads of animations.
In the future, I&amp;rsquo;ll be focusing on making it even easier and greener to load, adding image dithering and hopefully attempting to most entirely to green, solar-powered hosting.
What&amp;rsquo;s the idea? # This site is inspired by the concept of digital gardening.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Wait a minute,&amp;rdquo; you say to yourself, &amp;ldquo;Why do you, a design leader, need to spell out a design process? Doesn&amp;rsquo;t your team do that work?&amp;rdquo; Sure, the team might do it, but it&amp;rsquo;s important to spell out out for two reasons:
I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t ask my team to do anything I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t do myself. And depending on the situation, I may actually do it myself. Practice, after all, is how you stay sharp and relevant.</description>

Biography # I’m not like other design leaders.
My ideal day isn’t sitting in strategy meetings all day, managing managers. Instead, I find joy in working at both the strategic tactical level. Some call it a player-coach, I call it my happy place.
Since starting my career, I&amp;rsquo;ve built high-performing, deeply collaborative design teams from scratch and designed 5-star mobile apps.</description>

      <description>The most effective process is one that&amp;rsquo;s resilient and adaptable. That means being principle-driven and not process-driven. Here’s why: each project, problem, and team are unique. Each person’s insight and experience are, too. Following principles instead of a rigorous process lets us honor that uniqueness to deliver truly wonderful results. Not only that, we can move quickly and with intention to deliver great software.

This is a modern take on the classic Beatles shirt, focused on the design process. I originally designed this for BlendConf, a lovely conference in Charlotte (RIP).
Each shirt will be unique, as the gradients have to be made by hand.
This shirt is printed on an ultra-soft, vintage black cotton shirt. There are also neat printing processes at work, notably something called split fountain gradients.</description>

      <description>About Uptown Sans
What if Jim Flora (a record cover designer from the 50s), Saul Bass, and Eric Carle got together for tacos and made a typeface? That’s the vibe of Uptown Sans. It’s a little weird, a little loud, and full of energy. It’s sure to help you express yourself in just the right way.
Buy it at Fontspring
Cool, so what’s it good for?
Uptown Sans is best used large.</description>

      <description>My forthcoming book for Rosenfeld Media, due out in 2023. It&amp;rsquo;s about how to have hard conversations with anyone at work. Too few teams truly embrace healthy conflict—the secret to building great products—so I conduct workshops that teach you how to leverage it with practical, equitable, non-prescriptive methods to craft the best possible version of your product, your team, and even yourself.
My workshops give you tools you can use immediately in your next tough conversation.</description>

      <description>I offer half and full-day workshops that help teams unlock the secret to building great products: embracing healthy conflict and building psychological safety. We&amp;rsquo;ll work together to craft plans tailored to your team&amp;rsquo;s needs. Since beginning my speaking career, I&amp;rsquo;ve:
Talked with web3 engineers at ETHDenver on why they should care about design Given a masterclass at Rosenfeld’s Design at Scale Conference to product managers and designers on how and why to have hard conversations Showed fintech startups on how to unlock their creative thinking with a little more mindfulness and deep focus I care deeply about bringing more mindfulness to your craft and more humanity to your relationships at every level—I’m prepared to show you how that directly benefits your company, too.</description>
