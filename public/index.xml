      <description>Success criteria for apps and websites # As of writing, the goal is to follow WCAG 2.1, but falling back to WCAG 2.0 is acceptable. The following success criteria are below. This has been helpfully adapted by Kris Rivenburgh.
WCAG 2.0 AA # Section 1: Alternatives
Alt text (1.1.1): All images and non-text content needs alt text (there are exceptions) Video &amp;amp; Audio alternatives (1.2.1): All video-only and audio-only content has a text transcript.</description>

      <description>Here we get to bring our creation to life. This will require close collaboration with the rest of your team.
This covers # Building Handoff Expected outcomes # A working product A happy client Happy users Building # Make use of components, both in the design tool and web platform (if that&amp;rsquo;s applicable). This will reduce the hassle everyone will go through when updates are needed.
It is critical to use proper HTML tags and semantic markup to ensure the site performs well in search engines and with accessibility devices.</description>

      <description>What does good collaboration look like? Some thoughts:
To Designers # Attend ceremonies with engineers Treat this like a user interview, you&amp;rsquo;re listening for where they may be getting confused Cross pair with Engineering and PM Get into their backlog or development environment how should cross pairing work? when and how often? what does each do? Bring them into your design file Ensure Engineers have validated and modular designs (with users, stakeholders, and Engineers) to build Do what you can to shorten the understanding gap, with examples: Engineering: learn HTML/CSS/JS, learn basic git PM: plan design work with your PM, co-create stories in your backlog Pair with other designers Designers get better at their craft when we learn by doing work with someone else.</description>

      <description>How we communicate about our work is just as important as the effort that went into making it. Read the following carefully.
General guidance # Show in context # It’s always best to show something in context, and at the right fidelity. To that end:
Prefer to show something interactive over something static Prefer to show something in context (e.g. if it’s an app, show it on a phone. A site should be demoed in a browser.</description>

      <description>This segment helps us validate our thinking through testing and exploration. We may repeat things in segment multiple times to ensure we’re heading in the right direction before we begin building. Alternatively, we may truncate this process should our intuition or client&amp;rsquo;s knowledge help us reach a better solution faster.
This covers # Using the right fidelity and tool for the job Thinking in systems Collaborating with your team Designing for accessibility Presenting effectively Validation and user testing Expected outcomes # Validation on our ideas from users, stakeholders, and our team An inclusive, accessible design A ready-to-build design (or design system) Use the right fidelity and tool for the job # When designing, we need to work at the right fidelity.</description>

      <guid>https://joshuamauldin.com/guides/guides-00007/</guid>
      <description>💡 The big idea here is to **stay quiet and listen** to the person. It&#39;s okay to add in clarifying questions (e.g. &#34;could you say more&#34; or &#34;what led you to that?&#34;), but otherwise let them take the lead.

      <description>Ethnographic interviews help us understand users in their own environment, the problems they face, and how they face them.
The main goal here is to listen and avoid injecting your own bias into the project. Let the person you&amp;rsquo;re interviewing speak much more than yourself.
Once you&amp;rsquo;re done, synthesize your insights and share them out with your client. Some good talking points:

      <description>Guiding Principles # 💡 These principles—and how we apply them—are a critical part of what sets us apart from everyone else. They are also what influence the tactics we use. **Read these carefully.** Our work is careful # Design is like woodworking. To get the best from your piece of wood, you need to understand its properties: things like knots and grain’s direction. Likewise, when we understand the problem and the paths available to us, the solutions tend to reveal themselves We are responsible for what we put into the world so we must consider “edge cases” (aka people) We believe that the richest insights come from spending quality time with the problem, isolated from distractions We build psychological safety among our teammates, stakeholders, and users so that we can have hard conversations when necessary We map the ideals set forth in this playbook to reality.</description>

      <description>This is how to take yours and others’ privacy/safety into account.
Get a VPN to encrypt your browsing and data. I use Private Internet Access, it’s like $3/mo and covers all my devices Use Signal or other fully end to end encrypted calls, texts, and videos. Do not use regular SMS or phone calls, they can be tracked. FaceTime audio will do if no other option is available. Do not share whereabouts online, don’t send sensitive info via twitter and Instagram.</description>

      <description>We use this segment to understand the problem, why it exists, and define areas of focus. This includes big-picture brainstorming about the ideal solutions, learning about the people using our product, the stakeholders, and the space we’re working in. Everyone (designers, product managers, engineers, and stakeholders) is involved in this phase.
While the tactics and tools we&amp;rsquo;ll use vary project by project, we must make sure to cover the following 4 items.</description>

      <description>We observe users in their environment so that we fully understand the problem and the context in which they work.
We want everything we design to be to the direct benefit of everyone involved. There’s no better way to see how you can help someone than hearing them say it in their own words.

We need more good feedback in our world, and I don’t just mean the type of feedback that celebrates your good work. I’m talking about feedback that is actionable, specific, and kind; feedback that does not set us on edge or make us fall into an anxious spiral; feedback that helps us collaborate more effectively. The kind of feedback that is actually really hard to do when working remotely.</description>

      <description>We deal with burnout, too, and need to recharge our batteries. We can&amp;rsquo;t all take vacations or mental health days, but we can leverage an idea from phones: low power mode. We can&amp;rsquo;t go full speed all the time, much though we&amp;rsquo;d like. Here&amp;rsquo;s what my essentials were, and I found it helpful to define what things weren&amp;rsquo;t, too.

I had a lot of good responses to a question I put out on LinkedIn about advice for product design portfolios so I thought I’d expound on that here in hopes of helping you get called in for an interview.
While the principles here are applicable to almost all types of design roles, I’m going to narrow the focus of this to folks who are seeking a product design role.</description>

      <description>Something I deeply believe is that if you’re able to have focused time to work, you’re going to be able to go further, faster, and deeper than those who don’t.
That’s been especially true for me in this time of quarantine. When this began, I was hyper-available to people, answering emails and chats much quicker than I would usually. That, paired with the uncertainty of this pandemic made for a huge drag on my focus and craft.</description>

I keep wondering what we can do to ensure we’re building a better world with the products we make and if we need a code of ethics. So often I see people fall through the cracks because they’re “edge cases” or “not the target audience.” But at the end of the day, we’re still talking about humans.
Other professions that can deeply alter someone’s life have a code of ethics and conduct they must adhere to.</description>

Remember the last time you couldn’t get something out of your head and you woke up thinking about it in the middle of the night? The last few weeks of quarantine have been one continuous stretch of undifferentiated time and it’s become hard to turn things off. So I’ll share what I did about it in hopes of it helping you too. After putting this self-care routine into practice, I’ve been much more effective and focused during the day.</description>

Here’s the most helpful thing I’ve ever learned by far about conflict: before you have a conversation with someone, make sure you assume positive intent. Read on to discover a technique you can use to apply that idea — if you’re like me, you’ll find it will resolve most conflict before it starts. And, in a fun plot twist, we’ll also cover how this idea shouldn’t be applied at all times because it can harm underrepresented folks if we aren’t careful.</description>

The Legend of Zelda
I played a lot of video games growing up. It all started with The Legend of Zelda. I had such bad allergies that most of my adventuring had to be more pixel-based than anything. I didn’t expect to learn all that time spent playing video games would amount to anything, especially when it came to conflict resolution. Turns out there’s a lot more in common with old school video games and modern day human behavior than you’d think.</description>

It was hard to get any quiet time in my own head and I was tired of my tiny illuminated rectangle commanding my attention.
When I put a stop to it, I became more at peace.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m really fed up with notifications.
When it&amp;rsquo;s not the group chat blowing up, it&amp;rsquo;s a breaking news alert. When it&amp;rsquo;s not a reminder to meet your step goal, your budget app is letting you know you&amp;rsquo;ve spent too much at Starbucks this week.
Now, before you say anything, I know. I can just turn them off.
But I want certain notifications to get through. Texts from my Mom, for example.</description>

Push notifications are incredibly handy for giving you important information. Your flight being delayed? Really helpful to know. Getting a notification for everything one of the Avengers is posting about? Probably not.
Just like you’re going to ignore or shut down the person who continuously interrupts you, you’re more likely to do the same to an app that bothers you with trivial information.
Push notifications are interruptive and we must be careful in our use of them if we are to retain our customers’ happiness and trust.</description>

I’ve had lots of conversations about typography over the last few years. Which is cool, because I love it so much (so much that I decided to make my own typeface). It’s exciting to see so many designers caring about making a beautiful group of letters that people want to read.
One common theme I see in these conversations is how to get the best readability with text. We usually end up talking about serif vs sans serif, line height, line spacing, and other tricks.</description>

I started with style guides like any other obsessive-compulsive designer: with the desire to make it simple to maintain and grow a design. Plus, knowing which component to use in a given situation is nice, too, right? Since making this a regular practice, I’ve found it’s been like having a nice combination of a CSS class and a pattern library all in one.
One of the first questions, understandably, is why use Fireworks for a style guide?</description>

      <description>About # Basquiat How&amp;rsquo;s this built? # I use Hugo, a static site generator. It&amp;rsquo;s working with Go, markdown, and powered by GitHub pages. There&amp;rsquo;s no fancy CMS, no loads of animations.
In the future, I&amp;rsquo;ll be focusing on making it even easier and greener to load, adding image dithering and hopefully attempting to most entirely to green, solar-powered hosting.
What&amp;rsquo;s the idea? # This site is inspired by the concept of digital gardening.</description>

      <description>My Design Philosophy # The most effective process is one that&amp;rsquo;s resilient and adaptable. That means being principle-driven and not process-driven. Here’s why: each project, problem, and team are unique. Each person’s insight and experience are, too. Following principles instead of a rigorous process lets us honor that uniqueness to deliver truly wonderful results. Not only that, we can move quickly and with intention to deliver great software. You can read how it looks in practice, too.</description>

      <description>My Design Process # &amp;ldquo;Wait a minute,&amp;rdquo; you say to yourself, &amp;ldquo;Why do you, a design leader, need to spell out a design process? Doesn&amp;rsquo;t your team do that work?&amp;rdquo; Sure, the team might do it, but it&amp;rsquo;s important to spell out out for two reasons:
I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t ask my team to do anything I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t do myself. And depending on the situation, I may actually do it myself. Practice, after all, is how you stay sharp and relevant.</description>

This is a modern take on the classic Beatles shirt, focused on the design process. I originally designed this for BlendConf, a lovely conference in Charlotte (RIP).
Each shirt will be unique, as the gradients have to be made by hand.
This shirt is printed on an ultra-soft, vintage black cotton shirt. There are also neat printing processes at work, notably something called split fountain gradients.</description>

      <description>We Need to Talk # My forthcoming book for Rosenfeld Media, due out in 2023. It&amp;rsquo;s about how to have hard conversations with anyone at work. Too few teams truly embrace healthy conflict—the secret to building great products—so I conduct workshops that teach you how to leverage it with practical, equitable, non-prescriptive methods to craft the best possible version of your product, your team, and even yourself.
My workshops give you tools you can use immediately in your next tough conversation.</description>

We&amp;rsquo;ll work together to craft plans tailored to your team&amp;rsquo;s needs. Since beginning my speaking career, I&amp;rsquo;ve:
Talked with web3 engineers at ETHDenver on why they should care about design Given a masterclass at Rosenfeld’s Design at Scale Conference to product managers and designers on how and why to have hard conversations Showed fintech startups on how to unlock their creative thinking with a little more mindfulness and deep focus I care deeply about bringing more mindfulness to your craft and more humanity to your relationships at every level—I’m prepared to show you how that directly benefits your company, too.</description>
