<ul>
<li>Reframing is one of the most important mind-sets of a designer. Many great innovations get started in a reframe. In design thinking we always say, “Don’t start with the problem, start with the people, start with empathy.”</li>
<li>But before you can figure out which direction to head in, you need to know where you are and what design problems you are trying to solve.</li>
<li>In design thinking, we put as much emphasis on problem finding as we do on problem solving.</li>
<li>Our problems become our story, and we can all get stuck in our stories.</li>
<li>Deciding which problems to work on may be one of the most important decisions you make, because people can lose years (or a lifetime) working on the wrong problem.</li>
<li>“I want to go back to school and become a doctor, but it will take me at least ten years, and I don’t want to invest that much time at this stage of my life. What do I do about it?” These are all gravity problems—meaning they are not real problems. Why? Because in life design, if it’s not actionable, it’s not a problem. Let’s repeat that. If it’s not actionable, it’s not a problem. It’s a situation, a circumstance, a fact of life. It may be a drag (so to speak), but, like gravity, it’s not a problem that can be solved.</li>
<li>it’s impossible to predict the future. And the corollary to that thought is: once you design something, it changes the future that is possible.</li>
<li>Anytime you start to feel your life is not working, or you’re going through a major transition, it’s good to do a compass calibration. We do them at least once a year.</li>
<li>Dysfunctional Belief: Work is not supposed to be enjoyable; that’s why they call it work. Reframe: Enjoyment is a guide to finding the right work for you.</li>
<li>Remember that designers have a bias to action—which is just another way of saying that we pay a lot of attention to doing things, and not just to thinking about things.</li>
<li>Activity Log (where I record where I’m engaged and energized) • Reflections (where I discover what I am learning)
<ul>
<li>Note:update you report&rsquo;s form for this</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Quantity has a quality all its own. In life design, more is better, because more ideas equal access to better ideas, and better ideas lead to a better design. Expanding your thinking improves your ability to ideate and allows for more innovation.</li>
<li>Designers learn to have lots of wild ideas because they know that the number one enemy of creativity is judgment.</li>
<li>As a life designer, you need to embrace two philosophies:
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>You choose better when you have lots of good ideas to choose from.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>You never choose your first solution to any problem.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>With help, Melanie got unstuck by adopting a design thinking mind-set, remembering what her real problem was, and exploring some prototypes.</li>
<li>Don’t make a doable problem into an anchor problem by wedding yourself irretrievably to a solution that just isn’t working.</li>
<li>It is okay for prototypes to fail—they are supposed to—but well-designed prototypes teach you something about the future.</li>
<li>You are legion. Each of us is many. This life you are living is one of many lives you will live.</li>
<li>Working with adults of all ages, we’ve found that where people go wrong (regardless of their age, education, or career path) is thinking they just need to come up with a plan for their lives and it will be smooth sailing. If only they make the right choice (the best, true, only choice), they will have a blueprint for who they will be, what they will do, and how they will live. It’s a paint-by-numbers approach to life, but in reality, life is more of an abstract painting—one that’s open to multiple interpretations.</li>
<li>Chung had learned life design. He had tools he could use, and accepted that there was more than one happy path he could chart his life by.</li>
<li>Dysfunctional Belief: I need to figure out my best possible life, make a plan, and then execute it. Reframe: There are multiple great lives (and plans) within me, and I get to choose which one to build my way forward to next.</li>
<li>One started with three ideas in parallel,</li>
<li>Note:This is how my brain should work</li>
<li>The conclusion is that if your mind starts with multiple ideas in parallel, it is not prematurely committed to one path and stays more open and able to receive and</li>
<li>“Building is thinking”</li>
<li>At Stanford, we believe anything can be prototyped, from a physical object to public policy.</li>
<li>When you are trying to solve a problem, any problem, you typically start with what you know about the problem: you start with the data. You need enough data so that you can understand what causes what, and what is likely to happen when something else happens.
<ul>
<li>Note:design thinking in a nutshell</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Prototypes help you visualize alternatives in a very experiential way.</li>
<li>Not only is it true that doing prototyping is a good idea; it’s equally true that not prototyping is a bad and sometimes very costly idea.</li>
</ul>
