The following success criteria are below. This has been helpfully adapted by Kris Rivenburgh.\nWCAG 2.0 AA # Section 1: Alternatives\nAlt text (1.1.1): All images and non-text content needs alt text (there are exceptions) Video \u0026amp; Audio alternatives (1.2.1): All video-only and audio-only content has a text transcript. Transcripts are clearly labeled and linked below the media. Closed captioning (1.2.2): All video with sound contains accurate closed captioning. Audio description (1.2.3): For any video, add an alternative video that includes an audio description of information not presented in the original video’s soundtrack (exceptions) or include a text . Live captions (1.2.4): Any live video presentations must have closed captions. Audio description (1.2.5): An audio description is optional under 1.2.3 level A but not in 1.2.5 AA. Section 2: Presentation\nWebsite structure (1.3.1): Use proper markup techniques to structure your website’s content (e.g. use correct heading tags and HTML for ordered and unordered lists) Meaningful order (1.3.2): Present content in a meaningful order and sequence so that it reads properly. Sensory characteristics (1.3.3): When providing detailed instructions, make it so they aren’t reliant on a single sensory ability. Use of color (1.4.1): Do not rely on color alone to convey information. Audio control (1.4.2): Any audio must be able to be paused, stopped, or muted. Color contrast (1.4.3): There must be a color contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 between all text and background. Text resize (1.4.4): Text must be able to be resized up to 200% without negatively affecting the ability to read content or use functions. Images of text (1.4.5): Do not use images of text unless necessary (e.g. logo). Section 3: User Control\nKeyboard only (2.1.1): All content and functions on a website must be accessible by keyboard only (i.e. no mouse). No keyboard trap (2.1.2): Keyboard-only users must never get stuck on any part of the website; they must be able to navigate forwards and backwards. Adjustable time (2.2.1): If there any time limits on a website, users have the ability to turn it off, adjust it, extend it. Pause, stop, hide (2.2.2): If there is content that blinks, scrolls, moves, users must have the ability to pause, stop, or hide it. Three flashes or below (2.3.1): Web pages do not contain anything that flashes more than three times in any one second period. Skip navigation link (2.4.1): A “Skip to Content” or “Skip Navigation” link allows users to bypass the heading and go straight to the main content. Section 4: Understandable\nPage titles (2.4.2): Each page of a website needs to have a unique and descriptive page title. Focus order (2.4.3): Users must be able to navigate through a website in a logical sequential order that preserves meaning. Link anchor text (2.4.4): The purpose of each link should be clear based on its anchor text (e.g. don’t use “click here”) Multiple ways (2.4.5): There are multiple ways to access different pages/information on a website (e.g. search bar, nav menus, sitemap, breadcrumbs, helpful links after content). Descriptive headings and labels (2.4.6): Headings and programmatic labels must be clear and descriptive. They do not need to be lengthy. Focus indicator (2.4.7): Any “user interface control” that receives focus from a keyboard user should indicate that focus on the current selected element (e.g. add a visible border around a text link). Website language (3.1.1): Set the language for your website (e.g. html lang=en) Language changes (3.1.2): Indicate any language changes for an entire page or within the content. Section 5: Predictability\nNo focus change (3.2.1): Nothing changes merely because an item receives focus; a user must actively choose to activate an item (e.g. hit enter to submit) before a change takes place. No input change (3.2.2): Nothing changes just because information is inputted into a field (e.g. form doesn’t auto submit once all fields are filled out). Consistent navigation (3.2.3): Keep navigation layout consistent throughout all pages of the website (e.g. same links in the same order). Consistent identification (3.2.4): Components that have the same function within a website are identified consistently (but not necessarily identically) (e.g. two check marks can indicate two different things as long as their function is different — one indicates “approved” on one page but “included” on another). Error identification (3.3.1): Make any form errors easy to identify, understand, and correct. Form labels and instructions (3.3.2): Programmatically label all form or input fields so that a user knows what input and what format is expected. Error suggestions (3.3.3): If an input error is automatically detected, then suggestions for correcting the error should be provided. Error prevention on important forms (3.3.4): For pages that create legal commitments or financial transactions or any other important data submissions, one of the following is true: 1) submissions are reversible, 2) the user has an opportunity to correct errors, and 3) confirmation is available that allows an opportunity to review and correct before submission. Parsing (4.1.1): Make sure HTML code is clean and free of errors, particularly missing bracket closes. Also, make sure all HTML elements are properly nested. Name, role, value (4.1.2): For all user interface components (including forms, links, components generated by scripts), the name, role, and value should all be able to be programmatically determined; make sure components are compatible with assistive technology. WCAG 2.1 AA # Orientation** **(1.3.4): Style your website so that it does not lock on or require a single display mode Input (1.3.5): Make it so forms can autocomplete information for users. Reflow (1.4.10): Ensure someone can zoom in on your website without requiring scrolling or without causing poor experience. Non-text contrast (1.4.11): All meaningful non-text content on your website should have sufficient contrast with the background. Text spacing (1.4.12): Make sure your text spacing is able to be adjusted without causing a poor experience. Content on hover or focus (1.4.13): Make it so any additional content (e.g. pop-ups, submenus) can be dismissed or remain visible if the user desires Keyboard shortcuts (2.1.4): If you have a keyboard shortcut, make sure a user can either 1) turn it off, 2) there’s a way to add another key in the shortcut, and/or 3) have the shortcut only active while focusing on a specific component Pointer gestures (2.5.1): Provide simple alternatives (e.g. single tap vs. swipe) to potentially complex finger motions on touch screens Pointer cancellation (2.5.2): Provide a way to cancel the trigger when you click down on a mouse or press down/touch with your finger Label in Name (2.5.3): Make sure any programmatic labels you make are aligned with the corresponding visual text Motion Actuation (2.5.4): For any functions that are activated by motion, provide a simpler, alternative means of action. Also, give users the option to turn off motion activation. Status Messages (4.1.3): When a status message appears, it should be coded with role or properties so that people using assistive technologies (e.g. screen readers) are alerted without losing focus Other considerations # Semantic HTML # It’s important To use the correct type of HTML element, as they tell search engines and accessibility devices what they’re looking at. If you see a layout done entirely with div or span , this should be a clue that work is needed. Sections should be organized with the section tag, blog posts contained within an article tag, and so on.\nText size # While this is general design consideration, it’s worth mentioning here that our text shouldn’t be too small. Shoot for your body copy to be around 16pt, and the smallest text (e.g. legal text in a footer) should be around 9pt.\nApps # Each mobile platform has its own accessibility tools built in. I recommend navigating through the app with VoiceOver (or the Android equivalent) enabled. You should be able to hear each part meaningfully identified as you navigate.\nHaving a proper touch target size is critical. Apple\u0026rsquo;s Human Interface Guidelines recommend 44x44pt as the minimum size for a touch area. It is possible to have smaller buttons, but ensure there is still enough invisible space around the button that makes it tappable.\nTools \u0026amp; Templates # You should prefer to use automated tools to assist us, not to perform the entire audit. You use these tools to identify problem areas, then apply expertise to solving them.\nIBM Equal Access (requires Chrome) Stark "},{"id":4,"href":"/art/00001/","title":"Art00","section":"Visual Art","content":"\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/docs/guides-00003/","title":"Collaborating","section":"Guides \u0026 Published Articles","content":"What does good collaboration look like?

I use Private Internet Access, it’s like $3/mo and covers all my devices Use Signal or other fully end to end encrypted calls, texts, and videos. Do not use regular SMS or phone calls, they can be tracked. FaceTime audio will do if no other option is available. Do not share whereabouts online, don’t send sensitive info via twitter and Instagram. Those companies will turn your info over in a flash. Do not log onto Instagram or Facebook, make sure background access, location, microphone are all disabled. Better yet, delete them from your device. These services are very good at determining your location and will cooperate with law enforcement in sharing that info. Turn on airplane mode and make sure Bluetooth is off before going to protest. Your phone can be tracked by technologies like Wireshark. Disable Face ID or Touch ID. Cops have forced phones to people’s faces or fingers to unlock. It’s illegal but still happens. Use a strong password, not 4 or 6 digit pins. Those can be guessed in 4 minutes to 11 hours. Do not keep sensitive info on your phone in case it’s confiscated. Remember, there isn’t just data on there about you, there’s data on your friends, which could lead to their arrest and/or a threat to their safety. If your phone is confiscated and returned to you, do not unlock it. It’s likely been compromised by an app called HideUI, which stores your passcode. Cops engineer scenarios to take your device when you’re being processed, let you have it to get some numbers, then snoop on everything else in your phone. If you back your phone up to the cloud, know that Apple regularly unencrypts and shares this data with law enforcement. They talk big about privacy on your phone but don’t talk about how they will let law enforcement have your data if you use iCloud. Turn on Advanced Data Protection.

I’m talking about feedback that is actionable, specific, and kind; feedback that does not set us on edge or make us fall into an anxious spiral; feedback that helps us collaborate more effectively. The kind of feedback that is actually really hard to do when working remotely.\nIn this article, I’ll discuss a few ways to get around that difficulty. We’ll start by learning what causes feedback sessions to get off track, how to prevent this from happening, and what to do when this happens.\nThis article is targeted toward designers and developers who are currently working remotely or are planning to switch to remote work.\nImagine… # You’re part of a remote design team in a small company that is currently having you focus on revising their to-do app’s design based on some customer feedback and some ideas that the company wants to validate. During your presentation to the company, someone interrupts you. With their camera off, they say: “Wait, why are we wasting time doing this? The existing page is fine. The older colors and layout were better and this new thing feels clunky. Just put the sign-up call to action at the top and be done with it.”\nYou’ve been doing this for a few years, so this isn’t new to, you but you still feel like you got the wind knocked out of you. You get flushed and a little angry, because this person hasn’t always been so unfriendly to you before, and you don’t want to look bad in front of the leadership. You start to stumble over your words, which you think makes you look bad. Now you’re in a downward spiral.\nWhy Does Negative Feedback Elicit Such Strong Responses? # Mostly for two reasons:\nWe put a lot of ourselves into what we do, and so it’s natural, that when confronted with negative feedback, we would take it personally. That’s totally understandable and human. Our brain perceives critical feedback and arguments in the same way it did thousands of years ago. We’ve gone from a decentralized, hunter-gatherer society to a modern-day society so quickly (evolutionarily speaking, of course) that our brain hasn’t been able to keep pace with the changes. So, while we’re generally a lot less likely to be physically attacked at work today, our brains still perceive disagreements just as if we’re about to be. This is the reason why oftentimes the person who disagrees with you on a really hot design issue at work may appear to you in the exact same way as a caveman about to bean you with a rock to take your food. Our Brain’s Structure # Understanding how we route around this problem requires a brief discussion on how our brains perceive conflict. So, let’s dive into some neuroscience!\nWe’ll first discuss the three main levels of our brain:\nthe neocortex (where our rational, thinking brain lives), the limbic brain (where our emotions and feelings live), the reptilian brain (where our basic biological, survival programs live). When we are threatened, something called the amygdala (which is our brain’s “smoke detector”) sounds the alarm and does two things: it produces cortisol (a stress hormone) and diverts the blood flow from the neocortex to the lower levels of our brain. This means at this moment the part of our brain that thinks and reasons isn’t getting enough blood, so we become the real-life equivalent of the Incredible Hulk: just pure fight, flight, or freeze (only without the torn clothes and green skin). In his book Emotional Intelligence, Daniel Goleman calls this “amygdala hijacking.” It’s responsible for almost all of our conflicts going awry.\n“An amygdala hijack is an emotional response that is immediate, overwhelming, and out of measure with the actual stimulus, because it has triggered a much more significant emotional threat. The term was coined by Daniel Goleman in his 1996 book\nEmotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ.\nWikipedia\nPsychological Safety # You want the receiver of the feedback to feel comfortable enough to hear what you have to say without triggering their amygdala response, and you need to feel comfortable enough to say it. This is called psychological safety, and it is defined like this:\n“Psychological safety is being able to show and employ one’s self without fear of negative consequences of self-image, status or career (Kahn 1990, p. 708). It can be defined as a shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking. In psychologically safe teams, team members feel accepted and respected. It is also the most studied enabling condition in\ngroup dynamics\nteam learning\nWikipedia\nThe tools that follow will help build and maintain psychological safety by signaling that it’s not a harmful situation. Remember, when you lose safety, it’s because someone’s survival circuits kicked in. Better put, psychological safety is the underpinning of all good conversations.\nWhen there isn’t safety, resentment builds, feedback gets conveniently ignored, and people tend to clam up and not give real, helpful feedback.\nHow Can We Avoid It Going Sideways? # We’ll learn how to give high-fidelity feedback, share actionable and specific insights, as well as how to give a little conversational “first aid” by making refocusing statements.\nGive High Fidelity Feedback # Having a conflict when collaborating remotely causes us to lose what I call “high fidelity conversation,” leaving everyone at a disadvantage. Here’s my definition:\nHigh fidelity conversation\nAs more and more teams work remotely, we lose out on vital conversational cues, such as body language and tone of voice, leaving us in the dark about what someone truly means when they speak. Let’s dig into why this is difficult so that we can frame up an appropriate response.\nTo start, let’s go over the different levels of conversational fidelity we can have and discuss what we lose in remote work communications:\nIn-person, which gives us the full range of verbal and non-verbal cues, such as body language, tone of voice, and the full range of their voice. Video, which loses most of the body language due to cropping and the fidelity of people’s voices (video chat apps often compress audio). Phone, which loses out on all non-verbal cues. Text, which loses out on all non-verbal cues and the tone of voice. Email, which loses out on everything else, including the synchronous communication (read: Slack, various chat apps, SMS messages, etc.) and leaves you only with the transcript of what people say. The goal for these tough conversations is to have them in as high a fidelity as you possibly can. While email and Slack have dramatically reduced the friction for communication, it’s come at the expense of clarity and thoughtfulness. It’s far easier to send a half-baked email that leaves too much open to interpretation (remember the last email — or email thread — you got that was a forwarded email with just “thoughts?” included on a single line?). Plus, you’re at the mercy of the reader’s mood, state of mind, or distractions they experience, which could contribute to the missing key parts of your message.\nWhen we lose conversational fidelity, our brain’s survival circuits activate and fill in all the gaps in the communication with negative assumptions, leaving us prone to misinterpret someone’s message.\nThere are times, however, when real-time communication isn’t an option, especially for fully remote companies with people spread all across the world. In that case, consider using a tool like Loom to give your feedback, or you could even record an audio message on your phone and upload that. In doing so, you still retain your tone and give them some body language to work off of.\nFailing that, you’ll need to work a little harder to ensure things are taken well. Remember, you’re losing a lot of fidelity here, so you’ll need to compensate. Here are two of the best tips:\n**Be very clear with your language.**Humans’ brains like to fill in the gaps with negative assumptions. Use emoji. 😊Because our brains perceive emoji in the same way that it does a real human’s reaction. Don’t overuse them, but know they’re a helpful tool if people can’t see your real face. Ask For (And Give) Actionable Feedback On Specific Areas # When we start projects, we establish objectives and goals we want to achieve. Feedback sessions have exactly the same needs. So, when you gather people for feedback, be specific. Here’s a helpful guide:\nDon’t ask: # What do you think? Thoughts? Do ask: # I’d like feedback on the grid system, and particularly on the following elements of… This technically passes our contrast guideline tests, but it feels somewhat wrong. What do you think? We often mistake a client’s, a manager’s, or a stakeholder’s desire to contribute to your discussion for direction. But it’s not always so — generally, these people just want to help you solve the user experience or user interface design problems.\nI’ve found Asana’s method to be particularly helpful here — you need to bucket the feedback into three buckets: do, try, and consider.\n“A while back at Asana we noticed teams were laser-focused on shipping and would carefully ask if each piece of feedback was “launch blocking” at our launch reviews. Often non-blocking feedback would be brushed aside even if it was relatively cheap and would really improve the quality of the product. We reflected on what was happening and realized that we didn’t have clear language or norms on how to give or respond to feedback. And so, the Do, Try, Consider framework was born.”\nDo, Try, Consider — How we give product feedback at Asana\nWhen giving feedback, you should give the person something to explore or try. For example, instead of “Put the sign-up call to action here,” try “What other layouts might help us achieve our goal?”\nEvery piece of feedback should also be directly related to a goal, whether that’s the design being on-brand, responding to someone’s feedback, and so on. And if you aren’t seeing a way to be more specific, consider asking the other person to ask what specific type of feedback they’re looking for.\nHere’s how a feedback session could work:\nInvite people to have several minutes of quiet ideation, adding sticky notes to a virtual board. Once the solo time expires, group the similar sticky notes and then discuss each group individually, bucketing them accordingly.\nHere’s a little template that I made:\nAnd here’s how this could look like in action:\nPerson A:\nPerson B:\nPerson A:\nBe Kind # Before we continue, let’s discuss what I mean by being kind. I don’t mean that you should go around giving empty compliments to people or avoiding telling them things that aren’t quite right — both of these are ultimately harmful. What I intend by saying “be kind” is that you are direct with the other person. You have hard, direct conversations because you care. That’s true kindness. (And of course, be polite.)\nMore people need to learn that a polite suggestion as feedback is far more likely to get action than a snarky or unprofessional comment. And don\u0026rsquo;t insult the people you\u0026rsquo;re giving feedback to. We\u0026rsquo;re all human.\nMarch 11, 2022\nHow you frame the feedback has a direct influence on how it will be received. For example, which do you think is the better type of feedback?\n“This blue is lame. Just not digging it, man.” “This blue isn’t in line with our brand guidelines. Good thinking on the accessibility angle, though. You should chat with marketing to make sure that we use the right color shade, and at the same time, we have enough color contrast to keep this UI element accessible.” I hope you chose the second option. 😄\nWhen It Goes Sideways, Refocus # Despite our best efforts, conversations will still go sideways sometimes. Here, we’ll discuss the best way to perform some conversational “first aid” when things feel a little dicey. Enter what I call refocusing statements.\nA\nrefocusing statement\nHere’s what they look like:\nWhat you aren’t saying (the misunderstanding or misrepresentation). What you are saying (your personal or shared goal). An open-ended question that puts the conversation back in their court. Here are a few refocusing statements in action:\n“I don’t intend to imply you’re not a skillful enough designer, I’m saying that this isn’t up to our team’s standards. We can \u0026amp;mdash, and we want — to help you get there though.”\nBy framing the statements like in these examples, we actively address someone’s humanity and experience, and at the same time, we shift the conversation in a way that overcomes the objection or misunderstanding.\nNote: Please, avoid ending these with “does this make sense?” These non-questions only serve to open the door for condescension.\nAnd of course, give credit where credit is due — the inspiration for the refocusing technique came from Crucial Learning’s excellent “contrasting statement”, but I shaped it further to better fit my own practice.\nConclusion # In closing, let’s briefly recap some of the key points that I made in the article:\nSociety evolved quickly over the last few millennia, but our brains still “lag behind”, so we need to adopt a few new techniques to make giving and receiving feedback easier. If we can build and kindle psychological safety with our peers, giving feedback will be a much more effective process. We build psychological safety in part by having a high fidelity conversation — a conversation in which all participants have access to the full range of human communication, including tone of voice as well as non-verbal cues, such as body language and tone. (And if you cannot have a high fidelity conversation, then you’ll need to work a little harder to ensure things are taken well when communicating your feedback using text alone — remember to be very clear with your language and do use emoji.) Ask for (and give) feedback that’s actionable and specific. Use Asana’s methods to bucket the feedback into three separate “buckets”: do, try, and consider. Be kind. How you frame the feedback has a direct influence on how it’s received. When it goes sideways, try using a refocusing statement — a statement which addresses the misinterpretation, reestablishes focus on your goal, and asks open-ended questions to ensure clarity.

I’m not talking about just adding a photo of an obligatory sticky note session or notebook sketches. I’m talking about showing things you tested and discarded or an idea that you tweaked along the way.\nProduct design is a deep, murky world and hiring managers are looking to see how well you can swim in the muddy waters. Process work is key here.\nThe reason process work is important is that it demonstrates your thinking. If you just show those Dribbble-perfect screenshots, hiring managers won’t have any idea how you got there. It’s a lot like showing your work on a math problem. Anyone can guess at the answer and get it right. Not everyone knows how to do it. Hiring managers want to see that you know how to do it.\nHow much of this do you include? You don’t have to show every single step, just enough to make your point.\nPractical examples\nShow something you a/b tested or presented in a user interview, then talk about how it changed as a result of feedback Talk about the legwork you did or data you reviewed and how it informed your decisions Make sure your writing is concise and coherent # While visuals are important, don’t neglect the words you wrap around them. You’re only going to get 3–10 minutes of someone’s time, so pull out all the stops and don’t waste a word.\nWriting a portfolio entry is a little like designing a billboard, we have to design them for someone who’s speeding by. Remember: this isn’t a Tolkien novel, it’s essentially a pitch to get someone to call you. So make every word count.\nPractical examples\nBe able to summarize these things in a few hundred words or less:\nWhat problem you addressed Who was on your team and what your contributions were Who you helped What you learned along the way What you achieved and the outcome Demonstrate collaboration # Product designers are the glue that holds a project together. They’re the bridge between the client, the people using the product, the engineers, and product managers. So it logically follows that these folks would need to be able to collaborate with others on their project.\nIf you had a heroic moment on a project, you should absolutely tell that story. But don’t forget to show how you worked with others. That helps make strong case about what you’d add to the company you’re trying to join.\njonathanpberger\nhas this to say about collaboration in an interview with\nInvision\n:\nAlso, ask for help. Don’t hide in a hole.\nDon’t put your headphones on and block out everybody else. It can be gratifying to think that you’re some lone genius in your own little tower, but you’re probably not, and even if you are, it’s no fun up there alone. Engage in the conversation, and engage in the community.\nIn short, don’t try to be be the lone hero. Talk about how you assembled your own Justice League and tackled your problem together.\nPractical examples\nTalk about a time where you teamed up with a product manager or engineer to address a tricky problem. What’d you do or change as a result Share a story about how you went out of your way to get that reclusive stakeholder involved Show holistic thinking # If you want to prove that you’re going to be a valuable long-term team member, show that you think bigger. Think about the entire customer journey you’re designing for, the design system that powers the thing you’re building.\nDesign doesn’t exist in a vacuum, it’s a complex and shifting set of variables and only those who consider the whole picture are going to effective long-term. It’s not just about designing that app, it’s about considering how that app design fits in with the other touchpoints someone will have with the product.\nPractical examples\nShow a customer journey map or service blueprint Dive into the style guide or pattern library Talk about the big picture, not just one facet Bonus: talk about you as a regular human # I’ll speak for my company here: we’re hiring a whole person to join the team, not just a cog to fit in a machine. We hope you’ll feel welcome to bring your entire self to the team.\nPractical examples (if you’re comfortable with them)\nShare a little about yourself, how you got started, or what fascinates you about Design Share a personal or career goal Final thoughts # In this article, we discussed the most critical parts of a good portfolio by underscoring the need to show meaningful process work and how it relates to your decision. We discussed why we need to include examples of our collaboration so we don’t look like the lonely hero.

When this began, I was hyper-available to people, answering emails and chats much quicker than I would usually. That, paired with the uncertainty of this pandemic made for a huge drag on my focus and craft.\nAfter a couple months, I’m happy to say that I’ve found my groove again and figured out how to re-adopt Deep Work for a post-COVID era.\nI’d like to share what I’ve been doing in hopes of it helping you. I won’t say this is a prescription, I recognize that not all of this is applicable to everyone. I will say that it’s helped me and maybe you can find one tiny thing to help you.\nI’d like to talk about the benefits of Deep Work, dispel the myth of multitasking, and give you practical ways of making it work for you.\nWhat is Deep Work and Why Do I Care? # Deep Work is a term I stole from Cal Newport’s book of the same name. I use it as a label for the intensive, focused work we value so highly in design. It’s so important that we made it a core value in our design team.\nLet’s talk about how that applies to makers like us by reading an excerpt from Paul Graham essay called “Maker’s Schedule, Manager’s Schedule.” It gets at the way we use our time in a really eloquent way. The entire essay is worth reading, then reading again.\nIn this essay, Paul sets up the ways makers and managers use their time and how each person’s use impacts the other. Here’s what he has to say about a meeting that dots our schedule.\nI find one meeting can sometimes affect a whole day. A meeting commonly blows at least half a day, by breaking up a morning or afternoon. But in addition there’s sometimes a cascading effect. If I know the afternoon is going to be broken up, I’m slightly less likely to start something ambitious in the morning. I know this may sound oversensitive, but if you’re a maker, think of your own case. Don’t your spirits rise at the thought of having an entire day free to work, with no appointments at all? Well, that means your spirits are correspondingly depressed when you don’t. And ambitious projects are by definition close to the limits of your capacity. A small decrease in morale is enough to kill them off.\nTo me, this underscores one of my deeply-held beliefs: unbroken blocks of time are critical to being a contributing member of any team. Enter Deep Work.\nThe Impact of Deep Work # Think about metalsmiths, the ones who forge all the cool knives we use every day. Their work is incredibly careful and focused. It takes hours of dedicated focus to produce a blade. They have to hit the metal in just the right way in just the right spot. A lack of focus, even for a short time, means the possibility of a brittle blade that has to be reforged.\nDesigning and building software is no different.\nIf we lose focus, even for a minute to answer an email, we risk losing our focus and momentum. That design solution we’re working towards, we’ve got to go back to the beginning and retrace our steps. The algorithm we’re writing to process a bunch of data, we’re back at square one — all because of a short interruption. If you think this is an exaggeration, know that I’ve seen it happen firsthand to myself and others.\nAt work, we use Pivotal Tracker to measure our team’s progress towards a goal. One metric in there is velocity. Once we implemented deep work on the team, our velocity /tripled/.\nHow’d we do that? We blocked off time to do Deep Work. Let’s talk about things you can try next.\nWhat to Try # Here’s a short list of things that help get you going:\nIdentify What You’ll Focus On # This might seem obvious, but it’s so important that it’s worth reiterating. If you know what you’re working on, you can really dive in. Otherwise, your lack of focus will make for a less rewarding and productive time because you’re spending too much time trying to figure out what to do. So, do this before you get started.\nShut Off Notifications # Those tiny red dots and push notifications are the best at stealing your attention. I recommend setting aside some time where you’re separated from things that notify you. Put your phone on Do Not Disturb and drop it in a drawer where you can’t see it. You may still need a way to let someone reach you. I’ll cover that in another post.\nBlock Off Time, Ritualize It # For Deep Work to happen and be effective, you need chunks of time to do it. I’ve experimented with short sprints and long stretches of time. But the most important thing is to drop time on your calendar, block it off, and make it consistent.\nI’ve found you need at least 45 minutes of uninterrupted time to really get into flow. I find I can focus for an hour and a half, but then I need a break for half an hour or so before I go back.\nChunk Your Meetings # To call back to the problem outlined in Paul Graham’s essay from earlier, meetings — while important — can really sap your ability to focus. So put them in blocks. Find out when you work the best and protect that time.\nI’ve seen people have a morning or afternoon of meetings so they work uninterrupted in the other stretch of time. I work best in the morning, so I protect that time.\nIf neither of those work for you, try putting your interruptions near your lunch break.\nConsider The Optimum Time for Meetings # Our own Aldric had this addition. He says:\nWhen working on the manager schedule, keep those tips in mind for your colleagues on maker schedules, particularly if you must set recurring meetings with them (e.g. 1:1): try to use the beginning or end of their day, or before or after their lunch.\nWrapping Up # To conclude, let’s revisit some of the topics we discussed. By now, you and I hopefully share the belief that Deep Work is valuable, rewarding, and worth your time. It can really boost the quality of what you were hired to do. You’ve got a few tools in your toolbox to help facilitate that time, such as identifying what you’ll focus on, shutting off distractions, blocking time on your calendar for it, and chunking your meetings.\nWhat else have you done? I’d be eager to hear. Thanks for reading!\n"},{"id":24,"href":"/docs/published-00027/","title":"We Need a Code of Ethics.","section":"Guides \u0026 Published Articles","content":"Original post\nI keep wondering what we can do to ensure we’re building a better world with the products we make and if we need a code of ethics. So often I see people fall through the cracks because they’re “edge cases” or “not the target audience.” But at the end of the day, we’re still talking about humans.\nOther professions that can deeply alter someone’s life have a code of ethics and conduct they must adhere to. Take physicians’ Hippocratic oath for example. It’s got some great guiding principles, which we’ll get into below. Violating this code can mean fines or the losing the ability to practice medicine.\nWe also build things that can deeply alter someone’s life, so why shouldn’t we have one in tech?\nWhile this isn’t a new subject by any stretch, I made a mini one of my own. It’s been boiled down to just one thing and is flexible enough to guide all my other decisions. I even modified it from the Hippocratic Oath:\nWe will prevent harm whenever possible, as prevention is preferable to mitigation. We will also take into account not just the potential for harm, but the harm’s impact.\nThat’s meaningful to me because our for years, tech had a “move fast, break things” mentality, which screams immaturity. It’s caused carelessness, metrics-obsessed growth, and worse— I don’t need to belabor that here.\nWe’ve moved fast for long enough, now let’s grow together to be more intentional about both what and how we build. Maybe the new mantra could be “move thoughtfully and prevent harm,” but maybe that isn’t quite as catchy.\nA practical example # Recently, a developer launched a de-pixelizer. Essentially, it can take a pixelated image and approximate what the person’s face might look like. The results were…not great.\nSetting aside that the AI seems to have been only trained on white faces, we have to consider how process this might go wrong and harm people.\nImagine that this algorithm makes it into the hands of law enforcement, who mistakenly identifies someone as a criminal. This mistake could potentially ruin someone’s life, so we have to tread very carefully here.\nEven if the AI achieves 90% accuracy, there’s still a 10% chance it could be wrong.\nAnd while the potential for false positives might be relatively low, the impact of those mistakes could have severe consequences. Remember, we aren’t talking about which version of Internet Explorer we should support, we’re talking about someone’s life — we have to be more granular because both the potential and impact of harm is high here.\nAccident Theory and Preventing Harm # Kaelin Burns\n(Fractal’s Director of Product Management) has this to say about creating products ethically:\n“When you create something, you also create the ‘accident’ of it. For example, when cars were invented, everyone was excited about the positive impact of getting places faster, but it also created the negative impact of car crashes and injuries.\nHow do you evaluate the upside of a new invention along with the possible negative consequences, especially when they have never happened before? So when you’re creating new technology, I believe you have a responsibility, to the best of your ability, to think through the negative, unintended, and problematic uses of that technology, and to weigh it against the good it can do. It become particularly challenging when that technology also has the potential be extremely profitable, but is even more important in those cases.”\nIf you’re looking for an exercise you can do, try my Black Mirror Brainstorm.\nIn closing # In this post, we discussed why we need a code of ethics in our world. I shared one thing that I added to mine. We also talked about the impact of not having one. You also learned about Accident Theory and have a shiny new exercise to try.\nI’m curious about one thing: What’s one thing you’d include if you made a Hippocratic Oath for tech?\nThanks for reading.\n"},{"id":25,"href":"/docs/published-00006/","title":"End of Day ceremonies, the key to sleeping better and staying focused during quarantine","section":"Guides \u0026 Published Articles","content":"Original post\nRemember the last time you couldn’t get something out of your head and you woke up thinking about it in the middle of the night? The last few weeks of quarantine have been one continuous stretch of undifferentiated time and it’s become hard to turn things off. So I’ll share what I did about it in hopes of it helping you too. After putting this self-care routine into practice, I’ve been much more effective and focused during the day. In these times, self care is key.\nI had been waking up every night at 2:30am thinking about something going on at work, the industry, my family, or the world we’ll be living in after this passes. It’s not that what’s going on is bad necessarily; it’s that I can’t shut it off.\nI hoped if I could take a few minutes at the end of each day to shut my brain down, I’d be able to sleep better. So I came up with an experiment: an End Of Day ceremony where I empty out my head so there’d be room to sleep. Experiment #1: journaling.\nHere’s what I write about # Anything notable from today How’ve I’ve been feeling What I’ve been wondering about What I need to do next I write about the good, the not so good, the seemingly banal (because that’s the stuff that’s caught in my head in the middle of the night). If it’s in my head, it’s going to become text in this journal entry.\nHere’s how to set it up # Find a journaling tool. # Invest no more than 20 minutes here. It’s important that your choice of software gets out of your way and makes writing pleasant. I use Day One (but something as simple as Google Docs or Notes could be enough to get you started.\nSet up a reminder each day at 5 PM to write. # Day One, thankfully, handles that for me.\nCreate a template that includes all the topics you want to cover. # If you’re a director like me, this could be how your direct reports are doing, or initiatives you need to track. If you aren’t, some ideas could be tracking how you’re feeling, or noting tiny wins you’ve achieved. Just keep it simple.\nTen minutes later, I’ve emptied out my mind, leaving me free to enjoy a more relaxed sleep.\nDelightful Surprises # This approach already yielded a few unexpected gems.\nThe first is that every morning I can start off knowing exactly what I need to focus on. I don’t spend any time looking for anything to do because Yesterday-Josh already figured that out and kindly set it in front of Today-Josh. It’s a huge boost to my focus.\nAnother bonus is the record of what I’ve been up to. It’s much easier to recall interesting insights from a project or decisions that I made so I don’t have to backtrack.\nAnd finally, it helps me be more intentional about setting and accomplishing my goals.\nIn closing # After two weeks of this End of Day ceremony, my experiment in self-care did exactly what I wanted it to: I sleep much better than before. My brain is a little less frenetic and I’m able to focus more at work. Turns out, just taking time to purge my brain was the key to it all.\n—\nPhoto by Alejandro Escamilla on Unsplash\n"},{"id":26,"href":"/docs/published-00012/","title":"How using Cranky Conclusions makes tough conversations easier","section":"Guides \u0026 Published Articles","content":"Original post\nEver needed to tell a teammate something tough but fear they’ll get too defensive? Here’s one way that’s proven to work. # https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:10184/0*kOKfC0fS6aLcRDxb\nPhoto by Matthew Henry on Unsplash\nYou’re going to say the technique I’m about to share is just a glorified way of manipulating someone. Hear me out though.\nNot all conflict is easy to address. We’re by no means perfect. We put so much of ourselves into our work that it’s hard to not take some feedback personally. Telling someone they’re under-performing or having a negative impact on a team can put them on the defensive quicker than you blink an eye.\nHow are we supposed to talk to someone about the sticky things? Sure, we could just dive right into it and risk them getting defensive. Or we could be a little more pragmatic.\nIntroducing Cranky Conclusions # Let me introduce you to my favorite preparation tool for hard conversations. It starts with a simple question:\nWhat’s the worst thing they can say about me? # This is helpful for two reasons: it primes your brain for empathy and prevents you from being caught off guard when you go talk to the other person.\nHow’s it prime your brain? By visualizing the worst places they can go, you’re putting yourself in their shoes. You’re also exploring what they might think when they hear this news.\nCranky Conclusions help you be better prepared for a conversation that could get weird. It works because you’ve you anticipate the negative places they might go even before you breathe a word of it them. They give you the chance to tailor your conversation and route around those bad thoughts**.** If you use them in a conversation, you’re going to short-circuit them thinking the worst case scenario.\nPutting it into practice: the smelly teammate # For example, let’s say you’re working with someone who smells like the inside of a moldy, smoke-filled motel that’s recently been unsealed after years of being shut off from any kind of fresh air. You appreciate them as a person and respect their work but the smell is oppressive and makes concentrating or staying next to them for more than a few moments difficult. If this example sounds really specific, it’s because it actually happened to me. I still remember the smell to this day.\nIf I do go and talk to them, I use Cranky Conclusions find the worst thing they can say. Here are a couple things that come to mind:\nI’m an asshole, they smell just fine I shouldn’t try to tell them what to do Armed with those thoughts, I can now go talk to them. Hopefully, I can prevent them from thinking the worst so they can actually hear what I have to say. I usually say something like this:\nYou’re going to think [the really bad thing]. Hear me out though. # Note that this statement doesn’t include “but.” Cranky Conclusions are just like apologies: if you include a “but,” you negate everything that comes before it.\nBack to the smelly teammate: once I made my Cranky Conclusions, I went up to them one-on-one to talk. I said “hey, I’m gonna sound like an asshole who’s trying to control you when I say this. Please hear me out: I’m very sensitive to the smell of smoke. When someone smells of it, it makes concentrating really tough. Is there any way that before we work together that you can do something about it?”\nLuckily, they were cool about it and offered to use some mouthwash before working together. Problem solved, but that was hard to broach for me because I know how touchy people can get when it comes to hygiene.\nOnce you’ve used a Cranky Conclusion in your conversation, you’ve likely short-circuited their brain from thinking its worst thoughts. Now you can have a more productive conversation.\nI’ve used this technique with my direct reports, my teammates, stakeholders, (and even family members). It’s been very successful in helping me talk about hard topics.\nGoing even deeper # You can go even deeper with Cranky Conclusions by asking how you might’ve contributed to the situation.\nIt gets a little harder from here. Looking at your role requires a mountain of honesty and willingness to be wrong. It’s like that because this exercise often highlights how selective your perceptions of a situation are. While we want to believe we’re being fair, we often aren’t; it’s because we forget to look at how we might’ve contributed.\nClaire Lew (CEO of KnowYourTeam) has a great perspective here:\nIt’s perfect that she asks you to think about what might be common sense to you but not to them. I have been lucky to have a few managers who operated that way. They were the most effective ones I ever had, by a long shot. While this applies well to the manager/direct report relationship, it’s also incredibly effective for teammates.\nWhat if I I don’t have any responsibility here? # You won’t always find that you have any responsibility for the situation being what it is.\nThis is especially true if you’re on the receiving end of harassment or abuse. I’d like to think that’s obvious but there are always one or two dudebros reading along that still don’t get it (hi, dudebros!), so I’m going to say it again: victims bear no responsibility for someone else’s actions. If you disagree, [Joshua points behind you] there’s the door.\nOverall # Cranky Conclusions are really helpful because at its core it’s a tool to build empathy. After all, you’re putting yourself in their shoes and asking yourself what they might say in response to some hard news. Cranky Conclusions also make it harder to get surprised in a conversation. You can even use it to start a conversation with one (for an example, go back and read the first line of this article).\nIf you want to go deeper, you can ask yourself how you might’ve contributed. It’s a great way to help you be fair in your perceptions because we’re often selective about our facts and the roles we play.\nTry this before your next conversation # Ask yourself “what’s the worst thing they can say about me?” If you think it’s going to be a hard conversation, use something from your Cranky Conclusions to start the conversation Take a moment and look at how you might’ve played a role in things being like they are "},{"id":27,"href":"/docs/published-00025/","title":"The Prime Directive and the limits of assuming positive intent","section":"Guides \u0026 Published Articles","content":"Original post\nHere’s the most helpful thing I’ve ever learned by far about conflict: before you have a conversation with someone, make sure you assume positive intent. Read on to discover a technique you can use to apply that idea — if you’re like me, you’ll find it will resolve most conflict before it starts. And, in a fun plot twist, we’ll also cover how this idea shouldn’t be applied at all times because it can harm underrepresented folks if we aren’t careful.\nThe Prime Directive # I facilitate a lot of retrospectives at work. If you’re unfamiliar with retrospectives, these are meetings that exist to help a team process how the last few days went. They generally cover what went well, what could be improved, and what was frustrating.\nOne thing I do before a retrospective with a new team (or team member), we go over The Prime Directive (no, not the Star Trek one). It’s this one from what Norm Kerth:\nRegardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand. # Retrospectives need to be a safe space to discuss how the last two weeks were for everyone. After all, you’re talking about things that need improvement and it’s easy for things to get heated. The Prime Directive helps enshrine psychological safety because it helps us frame every event as an opportunity for improvement.\nOnce you assume positive intent, it’s much easier to defuse tension when it arises. It’s easier because you’re building psychological safety.\nThe limits of assuming positive intent # I want to make a distinction that might be not be obvious: you can’t (and shouldn’t) assume positive intent in every scenario. It isn’t a magic wand you wave and resolve all conflict —actions have impact and that impact should be acknowledged. For example, If I step on your foot once, you probably won’t think I did it intentionally. It doesn’t mean you didn’t get hurt.\nSimilarly, it’s important to not negate the impact of someone’s actions just because they meant well. What I’ve found is that assuming positive intent can disproportionately affect underrepresented folks.\nI’ll let Annalee from The Bias explain:\nOn its face, [assuming positive intent] might not sound like a bad idea. After all, isn’t assuming the best in others generally a good way to go through life? What’s the harm in encouraging that within your community?The harm is that telling people to “assume good intent” is a sign that if they come to you with a concern, you will minimize their feelings, police their reactions, and question their perceptions. It tells marginalized people that you don’t see codes of conduct as tools to address systemic discrimination, but as tools to manage personal conflicts without taking power differences into account. Telling people to “assume good intent” sends a message about whose feelings you plan to center when an issue arises in your community.\nLet’s look at a more concrete example # Take Roz, whose boss regularly praises her appearance. Her boss — we’ll call him Luc — is a successful manager who’s a few generations older. He’s been a little touchy with some of the other women in the office but not her.\nLuc regularly praises Roz’s appearance by saying how beautiful she looks or how nice her hair is. One day, she’s in the middle of updating a document and she’s wearing a new top that’s a little revealing. Luc comes in and says how nice that new top is. “What the hell did he mean by that?” Roz asks.\nRoz is uncomfortable that her boss says these things to her. She’s not there to be seen, she’s there to work. While she can assume positive intent all day and know that Luc only meant to make her feel better, she still feels objectified.\nIf she does tell someone, say HR, they could point to their code of conduct and say “see here, it says we assume positive intent. Luc didn’t mean anything by this. Don’t make this into something it isn’t” and send her on her way. That sucks.\nShe might opt to quash her feelings, suck it up, and keep going, which also sucks. Or she could talk to Luc about it, risk the relationship, and have to do the emotional labor of educating him. This, too, sucks.\nWhat’s the ideal way forward here?\nIdeally Luc will come to this realization on his own and not force Roz or the other women in the office to fix it. That shouldn’t be their job. There’s another ideal option: have an ally step in to educate Luc, which takes the effort off of Roz.\nOverall # Assuming positive intent is a game-changer and tools like The Prime Directive help enshrine psychological safety in your workplace. While it does a lot of good, we have to make sure to not blindly apply it and ignore the impact of someone’s actions because it can disproportionately affect underrepresented people.\nTry this before your next conversation # Before starting a conversation, remind everyone (including yourself) about The Prime Directive. Do you believe it applies in this situation? Remember the limits of assuming positive intent and don’t ignore the impact "},{"id":28,"href":"/docs/published-00013/","title":"How video games taught me to be better at conflict","section":"Guides \u0026 Published Articles","content":"Original post\nThe Legend of Zelda\nI played a lot of video games growing up. It all started with The Legend of Zelda. I had such bad allergies that most of my adventuring had to be more pixel-based than anything. I didn’t expect to learn all that time spent playing video games would amount to anything, especially when it came to conflict resolution. Turns out there’s a lot more in common with old school video games and modern day human behavior than you’d think.\nGames of that era had such limited computing power that everything had to happen in a pattern. Enemies would move in a certain way — once you learned how they acted, you had a much easier time understanding how to defeat them. I’m fascinated by how that can apply to human behavior.\nLet’s explore how spotting patterns in behavior makes for better outcomes when it comes to conflict.\nThe big question you ask yourself # It all starts by asking myself “has anything like this happened before?”\nIf so, I’ll try to find three examples to share. Let’s say you’re going to talk to person who shows up late to client meetings consistently. Think up two other examples before you talk to them. I like to stay as objective as possible and avoid saying things like “you’re always late,” and focus on saying something like “the last three client meetings we’ve had, you were more than 15 minutes late.”\nOne event is almost too easy to explain away and isn’t usually enough to draw a useful conclusion from. Finding two examples helps you two piece things together — there could still be a lot you’re missing though. It’s only when you reach three that you come up with almost undeniable evidence for your conclusions about your issue.\nA quick note about assumptions # I’m not a big fan of assumptions generally. However, I am a fan of assuming positive intent. Sure, it’s possible that someone’s trying to cover their ass or being malicious — we’ll get into that another time — but isn’t it more likely that there’s just something they aren’t seeing? This is where patterns are really helpful: they help both of you connect the dots.\nI’m also assuming you have positive intent. If you’re cherry-picking things to just shut someone down, if you’re out for revenge, or you just want to be right, you should back off, full stop.\nOverall # It’s worth revisiting what patterns do well:\nMake it easier to help people see what’s really happening Help you make the strongest case when having a conversation Assist the other person in seeing their behavior’s impact Try this before your next conversation # Ask yourself if they’ve done anything else that’s similar If so, can you find two other examples? Check your motives: be fair and don’t cherry-pick to make someone feel bad So the next time you think about conflict, think about all the patterns present in those old video games — it could give you the clarity you need before talking to someone.\n"},{"id":29,"href":"/journal/2019-01-09/","title":"What habits or things do I need to cultivate for the next 25 years?","section":"Journal","content":"I’m trying to make sure I’m set up as well as I can be for my life in the future.

I feel like we all do. Sometimes, though, we don’t consider how this amazing thing we’re working on might have some unintended and negative consequences.\nIn my job, I help clients build products. Part of the process is framing the project and defining our goals. We also talk about anti-goals, which are things we absolutely don’t want to happen and run counter to our intentions.\nIf you’ve ever seen Black Mirror, the show excels at diving into how our products can have (severe) negative impacts on our society. I thought it might be an interesting idea to make a product design exercise out of it. Enter Black Mirror Brainstorms.\nThis exercise helps us guard against the negative effects of our goals by giving us a clear understanding of how our product could be misused. The outcome of this exercise is to more clearly define our anti-goals. Here’s how it works.\nAbout the Exercise # Groups of 3–4 people Play time: 30–45 minutes (depending on the number of groups) 2 minutes to explain/give example 15 minutes to sketch 2–5 minutes to present 5 minutes to define anti-goals Before the activity, create a template to distribute to each team Provide markers, paper, stickies Each team should get one template to work on together How to Play # The exercise breaks down into four sections: the brainstorm, quotes, plot points, and the poster. Here’s a template.\nNext we’ll start with an example to get us thinking.\nLet’s say we’re a large technology company who’s looking to have the most personalized content so people will spend more time in our product. To do that, we’re building a targeting engine that sifts through millions of data points to spot trends. Our goal is to figure out how this can go wrong for people who we’re collecting data on.\nNow let’s get to each of the sections.\nBrainstorm # Here, we’ll write down some of your ideas for what might go wrong. Here are a few areas to help frame your activity:\nEconomic Issues: could we enable bad faith actors to prey on vulnerable groups? Politics: could a corrupt government could use this info to identify and target dissidents? Social Issues: could our product reinforce already-present societal divides? Important note: some folks won’t do well thinking on the fly in a group setting. To help them, instruct everyone to take 2–5 minutes to think up ideas before talking with the group. The stickies you provide are perfect for this.\nQuotes # This section is for quotes people in the episode might say. It can also be things people say about the episode after watching it.\nDon’t be afraid to get dramatic or go over the top.\nPlot Points # Plot points are helpful in describing how this bad situation comes to pass. They’re the substance of the story. Consider these four as a starting point:\nThe characters: who’s going to be affected The setup: the well-intended idea The problem: how the well-intended idea goes wrong The effect: how the idea going wrong affects people The Poster # Here, we’ll communicate the big idea. I suggest using a big quote that sums up the episode. If a team’s so inclined, they could also do an illustration.\nAfter the Exercise # When everyone’s finished presenting, take a moment to look for common elements from everyone’s posters and write them on stickies. We’ll take the stickies, put them up, and group similar ones together. These are excellent candidates for anti-goals.\nWrapping up # We don’t have to look far to see how this might be helpful. Consider that Target figured out a teen was pregnant and started sending her pregnancy-related coupons, much to the shock and anger of her parents. Another time, Facebook year in review showed Eric Meyer a photo of his recently-deceased daughter surrounded by confetti and dancing people. None of these things products intended to be cruel. But because the designers didn’t consider the negative implications of their decisions, unintended things happened (and some of them were pretty rough).\nBlack Mirror Brainstorms are intended to help us consider the negative impacts of our work. By doing this, we help ensure that our products are great and don’t end up causing harm. The unceasing march toward growth will often pull us in unexpected ways and it’s easy let any negative impact of our decisions fall by the wayside.\nCredit and thanks # Adapted from Aaron Lewis and Gamestorming’s Cover Story activity.

In it, you walk through a 3D art gallery complete with with audio and imagery to understand their history.\nHaving primarily designed for mobile over the last few years, this was a fun new medium to explore. The new constraints and considerations were interesting, too.\nFor instance, I found typography worked a little differently here. Things like motion and interaction took on an entirely new form, too. Not only that, but the process for making VR apps were also a little different than most other projects. I’ll walk you through those here.\nInteractions # We have two main ways of using VR apps: with our gaze or a controller. each method has something different to consider, but I’ve found that they both affect how you design in similar ways. Let’s start with how they affect interactive objects like buttons.\nApple recommends buttons have a 44pt minimum touch target size for apps. You’re going to want to go larger for VR. If you use Google’s VR framework, Daydream, it recommends a default size of 64pt. While that’s considerably bigger, I found that increasing the size allowed for much better usability.\nIf you’ve ever heard of Fitt’s Law, you’ll recall that one of its key points is to make important elements larger and positioned closer to someone. That concept goes double for VR.\nVR environments, because of their immersiveness, make it easy to miss a button. If you’re using a controller, remember that it’s tougher to direct a pointer than it is to tap a button on your phone.\nIt’s fine if you want to focus on only using someone’s gaze to navigate. If that’s what you’re doing, show a timer or some other sort of progress bar when someone gazes on an interactive object. This makes it clear what will happen if someone keeps staring and it. Doing this also prevents accidental interactions. I’ve found that anywhere from half a second to one second for a timer is a good idea.\nMotion # What makes VR so much fun is its immersiveness and movement. We have into two main areas to consider here: how your body moves and how you move around within the app.\nHow your eyes and body move # First, I’m really thankful for the work of Mike Algers and Alex Chu here because they articulated these principles so well. Here, we’ll talk about eye movement as well as body movement.\nIf you want someone to see something without them turning their heads, you’ve got about 30º in any direction. Anything outside of that is out of focus and causes eye strain.\nWe can comfortably turn our heads about 60º in any direction before our muscles begin to fatigue. Moving more than 60º in any direction can trigger motion sickness, which we’re keen on avoiding.\nIts important to consider how far you’re making someone stretch themselves to use your app. Unless you’re making a VR app for yoga, remember that less stretching is better.\nHow you move within the app # The other type of movement is the motion someone experiences while using your app. While we can have more fun with snappy animations on desktop and mobile, we must be more considerate and delicate here.\nDon’t vary your motion speeds here, this is a huge trigger for motion sickness. No one should feel like they’re on a rollercoaster (unless that’s what you’re going for). In general, opt for slower or instant transitions.\nMost of my transitions take anywhere from 1–2 seconds in VR. That’s a much longer timeline than the 500 milliseconds most of my app animations take. It feels slower, but at least I’m not getting motion sickness here.\nTypography # Reading…kinda sucks in VR. I have a really big interest in typography (so much that I made my own typeface), so I spent a lot of time understanding this.\nThere are two reasons why reading isn’t so great: our devices and methods of experience greatly vary.\nOur devices # We have so many different devices capable of VR, all at varying resolutions and sizes. Some run at ultra-high resolutions, like the Galaxy S9, while others are at lower resolutions, like the iPhone. There are a few in between, like Playstation VR.\nBecause the resolution can vary so much, text can look blurry or crunchy. That’s especially true on lower-resolution devices.\nMethods of experience # The other factor is the methods we use to experience VR. We can use anything from a head-mounted visor that straps to your head to a Google Cardboard that you hold up to your face. They both come with their own set of benefits and tradeoffs.\nWhile holding something like Google Cardboard is the easiest and cheapest way to get into VR, what you gain in convenience you lose in comfort. Holding the VR device in your hands causes fatigue after a little while — we’re not used to sustaining that position. It also causes the experience to be a little shakier, which can cause eye strain and motion sickness.\nThe head-mounted visors are my favorites because they allow you to stay in the experience longer. You also get to use your hands if you want. These are generally a little more expensive than a Google Cardboard, which will be a barrier for some.\nSo what can we do to have better typography? # Downplay any kind of longer-form reading. Think about PowerPoint summary slides, that’s about the right amount of text to use.\nFocus on infographics and imagery when you can, even if they’re simple. This helps communicate your message with much more clarity and makes for quicker scanning.\nYou will inevitably have to set some text in paragraphs (and that’s okay!). Here are some considerations:\nUse only medium-to-bold fonts. Even on high resolution devices, thin fonts look crunchy and hurt both legibility and readability Make your default text size larger than usual. My starting point is about 24pts Shorten your line length from 50–75 characters to 30–40 characters Use as much contrast as you can with text, so consider setting your paragraph inside of a semi-transparent, dark background Process considerations # I haven’t encountered a designer-friendly environment for VR yet. The best thing you can do to get started is learn the basics of how to navigate within Unity and become good buddies with your engineer.\nFor a simpler experience, you could try Sketch-to-VR. You’ll need to realize that this is only to help you get a basic idea of what you’re building; the sizes and positioning won’t match your design 100%.\nYou’ll need to do a little work to test it out — it’s not so bad, I promise! Here’s how to do it.\nWrapping up # Clearly there’s a lot to VR, and a lot to be excited about. Best practices and patterns are still being worked out, but we know that we have to make different considerations for typography, motion, and interaction.\nIt’s my hope that one day a good prototyping environment will come around for VR, but the best thing seems to be to get close to your engineer pals here.

Up to that point, I’d received a steadily-increasing stream of messages from co-workers and friends—my head was buzzing as much as my phone. It was hard to get any quiet time in my own head and I was tired of my tiny illuminated rectangle commanding my attention.\nWhen I put a stop to it, I became more at peace.\nLooking deeper, I realized that I’d had a constant, low-level stress from what might come in from a push notification. You could blame 2016/2017 for that.\nI’d already whittled down my apps by removing email, Twitter, and Facebook from my phone. Instagram stayed because it was an inspiration source. That helped a lot but wasn’t enough until I stopped Messages from sending me notifications.\nWhat struck me most was that I never thought turning off notifications from Messages was an option. I’d received so many over the years that my brain thought that’s just how phones operated these days.\nA change in my relationship # I wanted to take a step back and change how we relate to our phones: we should take advantage them instead of letting them take advantage of us.\nI believe that device manufacturers should us choose what notifications we get based on what we’re doing at the moment. For example, if I’m at work, maybe I don’t get social notifications. If I’m at home, my co-workers can’t get to me unless it’s an emergency. Since that’s not possible yet, we only have drastic measures as an option.\nSo in light of that, I dumped all my notifications and started over. You may want to try it too.\nHere’s how I rethought push notifications # I’ve got a simple, two question way of dealing with it. For apps that can send push notifications, I ask this:\nWhich apps improve focus or send alerts to things that matter most? Which apps hijack attention and provide a distraction? Your answers will vary and I’d recommend keeping only the essential ones. The rest of those apps are still there if they’re needed—they just can’t call out to you and steal your attention.\nHere’s what gets to stay for me: # Anything security or safety related (Nest, Canary) Anything travel related (TripIt, Airbnb) One unnamed messaging app (so my wife can text me if necessary) Wrapping up # Notifications, while sometimes helpful, can be a huge time and attention eater. We shouldn’t be afraid to change our relationship with our phones because it can really reduce the stress we feel in our day-to-day lives.\nIf you’re feeling burdened by notifications like I was, use the framework I shared to cut out the things that don’t meaningfully make your life better.\nUltimately, the technology we create should work for us and not the other way around.\n"},{"id":33,"href":"/docs/published-00019/","title":"Notifications stress me out.

I can just turn them off.\nBut I want certain notifications to get through. Texts from my Mom, for example. Maybe when I get a friend request on Facebook.

It might also have consequences for our mood.\n\u0026ldquo;That bit of distraction does seem to kind of chip away at our good feelings and make us feel, perhaps, a little bit more anxious on a day to day basis,\u0026rdquo; says Elizabeth.\nI admit, over the past six months, my relationship to notifications has changed. Often, I ignore them, deleting them from my home screen sometime late at night without reading them.

Now, the best companies use animation to inform, delight, and reward the people using their products. Let’s talk about how animation helps and how to use it in our work.\nAnimation Provides Guidance # I think a lot about this quote from Steve Krug in Don’t Make Me Think:\n“We don’t read pages. We scan them.”\nNot only does it apply to interface design, it also applies to how we can use animation to communicate without words. While cleverly-written copy will likely be overlooked, an animation won’t because it doesn’t rely on words.\nhttps://youtu.be/8-vhbMx44qM\nFlipboard for iOS.\nYears ago, a trend in app design emerged where apps would have arrows on the screen, telling users where to look. That quickly became cumbersome and the need to simplify was apparent.\nFlipboard came along and did a nice take on that with their onboarding. It’s not cluttered with a billion arrows pointing this way and that. It’s subtle, and we know we can swipe up to get more because that’s what the animation showed. We’re also able to understand it quicker since you don’t have to read.\nhttps://youtu.be/hokZqdlKuR0\nSkillPop uses Stripe, which is pretty great when it comes to forms.\nAnother part of providing guidance is letting someone know when we need their attention. With Stripe, we see that the form shakes a bit if there’s an error, much like we shake our head when something is incorrect.\nWhat can we take from this? When we show, rather than tell, we reduce a person’s cognitive load. This makes it easier to get into using the product. After all, who reads instruction manuals unless they absolutely have to?\nAnimation Reduces Frustration and Abandonment # Google saw a 20% drop-off for adding half a second to their page load time. Similarly, Amazon saw a significant drop in sales for every tenth of a second they added to page load time.\nThis highlights how critical speed and performance are. There are times when we aren’t able to improve speed—perhaps our customers have a slower connection or the services calls are lagging. This is the perfect opportunity for animation to assist.\nViget Labs did a neat experiment showing that people are willing to wait around longer if there’s a branded loading animation. Their case study is worth a read, but here’s the highlight: custom loading animations have an overall lower abandonment and higher wait time.\nhttps://youtu.be/0-UY5Xy5JRQ\nTunnelBear for iOS. Watch with sound on.\nHere’s another example of how animation can decrease frustration: TunnelBear, a…beary good VPN client (not even a little bit sorry for that pun). Connecting to a VPN usually takes at least a few seconds or longer, and there’s only so much performance optimization that can be done.\nNot only does TunnelBear use animation to show us what’s going on while it establishes a secure connection, it uses animation in a novel way while we wait. We see our little bear begin to dig, then it reappears a moment later on the other side of the map. This helps us understand how VPNs work as well as makes the wait easier.\nhttps://youtu.be/mE0mh16w5Vo\nHopper for iOS.\nAnother example is Hopper, an app for finding the best price on flights. Searching and communicating with all the APIs that each airline company has takes time — some APIs have abysmal response times.\nHopper shows us a happy little rabbit hopping as fast as it can as the loader, which helps us think it’s working as fast and hard as possible. Sometimes the perception of speed can be as important as actual loading speed.\nhttps://youtu.be/PPLDDb1Kfew\nKayak for iOS\nIf we compare this with Kayak, it feels like we’re in a different world. While the load times are almost the same, looking at a progress bar fills people with boredom and they just want it to be over.\nWhat can we take from this? If we put effort into respecting another person’s time, they’re more likely to stick around.\nAnimation Makes an Emotional Connection # The animations we give a product are a direct extension of the brand and need special attention. Here are two examples.\nhttps://youtu.be/_IaQo59eoYE\nPause, a meditation app for iOS.\nPause, an app which practically radiates relaxation and equanimity, does a perfect job of helping someone relax. The animations here are slow, deliberate, and calming. Any anxiety or feeling of being over-busy melts away as the little circle grows and pulls in tinier circles.\nhttps://youtu.be/PQ3Q_WOKUtY\nZappos and the Super Cat for iOS.\nThe next app is a little more fun, and it’s Zappos. Part of their brand and mission statement is to “Create Fun and A Little Weirdness.” That’s why I was surprised and delighted to see a tiny Super Cat delivering a pair of Chucks to the cart. It made me want to add several more 😸.\nBest Practices # It’s great to talk about how animation can help, but let’s talk for a bit about how to put this into action.\nBe intentional and match the brand # Animation is best when it is intentional and reinforces the experience. Use this chart to help plot what kinds of animations to use.\nThe Brand Personality Spectrum, adapted from [somewhere].\nIf we’re designing a quiet, meditative app like Pause, that means it’s probably more familiar, happy, reserved, quiet, and off the beaten path. We’d probably avoid giant pops and flashy transitions. It may be perfectly fine, however, to use this with an exercise app designed to motivate.\nTiming is everything # Most people’s brains take about 200ms to begin processing something. Anything less than 100ms is considered instant since our brains have trouble processing information at that speed.\nAnimation awareness spectrum, adapted from Val Head’s Designing Interface Animation and Aerotwist\nThis means the best spot for most animations is 200–500ms. There’s not a hard and fast rule that says every animation should be in this range—animation is more art than science. If we’re working with larger, more complicated animations, they can and should take longer because of their complexity. Compressing them to fit an arbitrary number will only make it appear choppy.\nThat being said, it isn’t usually advisable to have animations lasting longer than one second unless it’s with a loading sequence. The more we delay someone from completing their task, the less likely they are to stick around. Animation must help rather than hinder.\nDon’t break accessibility # Not everyone can hang with motion. Some of us get motion sickness. Offering a low-animation setting can help alleviate that feeling. This can be the difference between someone who stays and someone who bails on an app.\nAfter iOS 7’s beta, people reported having motion sickness from all the visual effects. In response, Apple released a low animation setting to address that.\nFinally, for people with a history of epilepsy: we need to avoid flashing the screen or big color changes more than twice a second. Anything faster than that is a trigger.\nWrapping Up # In closing, animation helps people understand how to use an app, gives them feedback without overburdening their brains, and helps people create an emotional connection. Make sure to be intentional with all of your animations, time them appropriately, and don’t cause anyone motion sickness or worse by overdoing it.\nFurther Reading # If you’re looking to read more, I highly recommend peeking at these links.\nHistory of Animation (Webflow) Designing Interface Animation (Val Head) The Illusion of Life (Cento Lodigiani) 12 Basic Principles of Animation (Wikipedia) "},{"id":35,"href":"/docs/published-00022/","title":"Push Notifications, the good, the bad, and the wtf could u not (UX Collective)","section":"Guides \u0026 Published Articles","content":"Original post\nPush notifications are incredibly handy for giving you important information. Your flight being delayed? Really helpful to know. Getting a notification for everything one of the Avengers is posting about? Probably not.\nJust like you’re going to ignore or shut down the person who continuously interrupts you, you’re more likely to do the same to an app that bothers you with trivial information.\nPush notifications are interruptive and we must be careful in our use of them if we are to retain our customers’ happiness and trust. A push notification’s frequency, type, and priority can make or break someone’s faith in your app.\nWhat you should do # Push notifications are at their best when they are timely and helpful. Consider these tips when you’re figuring out what kinds of notifications to send.\nConsider how your app can help # Amazon does a great job of communicating your order’s status: I know when it’s shipped, out for delivery, and when it’s been delivered. I also know if there’s been a problem with the delivery, and I can act quickly to fix the problem.\nIf you’re a retailer or hospital, you know how much weather emergencies affect people getting to work. Letting an employee know you’re closed and they don’t need to come in could save them from an accident.\nBe judicious # While the occasional notification about a sale is acceptable, we must approach this with caution. Too many notifications and people will lose the goodwill we’ve built up with them.\nIt may also end up affecting your app’s ratings. People are 8x more likely to download an unknown app with high ratings, so it’s important to not abuse the privilege to send someone a push notification.\nAdd actions # Consider how you can save someone time by letting them deal with a notification on the spot. Apple lets you use two actions in a notification. Android allows “many,” leaving it up to you how many to add. My advice is stick to two, especially if you’re developing for iOS and Android at the same time.\nHere are a few examples:\nReplying to a message in the notification. Accepting an event invitation or snoozing an event alert. Tuning into your security camera feed or sound the alarm. Silencing a smoke alarm. Give people a choice # As your notification system evolves, make sure to give people the ability to choose what kinds of notifications they want as well as when they want to get them. This protects both your goodwill and App Store rating.\nFor example, people may not want to know about every promotion you’re running but do want to know when their order ships. Give them that choice.\nPeople also may not want notifications for certain apps when they’re at work, traveling, or at home. For example, I don’t want to get push notifications from my work Slack after-hours unless it’s important; it might be helpful to get them during the day, however.\nPeople may also want quiet hours. I haven’t seen an app that quiets itself when I’m at home or work, but it’s certainly on my wish list.\nWhat you should avoid # While iOS requires users to grant permission to send push notifications, Android doesn’t. This poses some interesting challenges in which we could be bugging someone without them really wanting to be bothered.\nAnnoying someone into opening the app # Don’t send needly interruptive notifications to people who’ve never opened your app. It’s not a good look—this erodes someone’s trust that you’ll respect their time and attention.\nAlso avoid begging users to re-open your app if it’s been inactive for some time. No one wants to look desperate for attention, neither should your app.\nAllowing destructive actions # Since notifications are dealt with in seconds, avoid including any kind of destructive action. Notifications can be dismissed accidentally—imagine the confusion and frustration accidentally deleting a message could bring.\nSending low-value notifications # Avoid sending notifications that don’t have anything to offer. While you might appreciate a customer visiting your store and want to thank them, it’s a bad idea to send a notification for that.\nIncorrectly prioritizing notifications # Android lets you set priority levels for notifications and provides five options for you:\nMax: these are the most important kinds of notifications. Use these for time-sensitive or critical alerts. This appears on someone’s screen no matter what they’re doing. High: most communication apps use this for messages. Default: your regular ol’ notification. Good for letting you know that someone’s order is processing or shipped. Low: for relevant information that’s not especially time-sensitive, like for earnings reports on companies you follow. Min: the lowest priority. For nearby points of interest or weather. Most of your notifications should be in the default category unless you have good reason to make it otherwise. Google allows for the min level, but consider whether or not you really need that notification if you’re prioritizing it that low.\nPeople who overstate the importance or urgency of what they’re saying are going to get ignored — the same principle applies here. You have a certain amount of trust with a person, mis-labeling your notifications is a great way to ruin that trust.\nWrapping Up # If you’d like to read more, you can head over to the iOS Human Interface Guidelines or Material Design to read more. I recommend starting with Material’s guidelines there since they’re more descriptive.\nOverall, treat notifications like the interruptions they are. Be respectful and only send them when necessary.\n"},{"id":36,"href":"/docs/published-00008/","title":"Giving Your Product A Soul (Smashing Magazine)","section":"Guides \u0026 Published Articles","content":"Original post\nAfter a few years of designing products for clients, I began to feel fatigued. I wondered why. Turns out, I’d been chasing metric after metric. “Increase those page views!” “Help people spend more time in the app!” And it kept coming. Still, something was missing. I knew that meeting goals was part of what a designer does, but I could see how my work could easily become commoditized and less fulfilling unless something changed.\nI thought of how bored I’d be if I kept on that path. I needed to build some guiding principles that would help me find my place in design. These principles would help grow and would shape my career in a way that fits me best.\nFurther Reading on SmashingMag: # Why Great Products Need Great Collaboration A Lean Approach To Product Validation Nobody Wants To Use Your Product What I’d like to share here is how I found my principles and regained a sense of fulfillment. I’ll also discuss one of them and hopefully convince you that it’s worth considering when we design products. Speaking of convincing, I’d also like to help you convince your boss that these things are important.\nOne small string that began to tie it together was watching Bret Victor’s talk “Inventing on Principle.” The first half is mostly a code demo; then, he gets philosophical and talks about how goals and principles help you. I believe that living by principles can lead you to some really interesting places — for me, they’ve helped me to find the right ways (and places) to work and the right projects to take on (like designing a typeface), and they’ve helped me to identify which areas of my life need to be nurtured so I don’t burn out.\nAdvocate For Design Having A Soul # I’ve worked on projects whose goals varied from increasing email signups by 10% to boosting ad impressions by 30%. It was honest work, to be sure. It’s important that our designs meet the needs of the product owners and our clients — this isn’t art school, and there are real constraints and requirements we need to address.\nHowever, it’s not enough to do metrics-based design. That in itself is a bit too clinical and detached, and where’s the fun in that? We need more.\nValidating and then meeting a project’s requirements should be the minimum of what we set out to do. Once we set those metrics as our baseline, we’re allowed to be more impactful and thoughtful as we get to the root of a design problem.\nWhat we need to shoot for is to help people fall in love with our products. That means pushing to give our designs a soul.\nHere’s what “emotionally connecting” means: It means you’ve created a product that stands out in someone’s heart. The product becomes what people reach for because it’s the most helpful. People might not be able to understand what you’ve done, but they’ll perceive that it’s better. This is one way to make a product that’s indescribably good.\nI usually ask these two questions, which get at part of what helps people fall in love with a product:\nWhat’s going to help someone really find this useful? What’s going to make them care about it? For years, we’ve focused on making our websites and products be functional, reliable and usable. These qualities are the bedrock of any good product, but it’s when we add a soul to a product that it really comes alive.\nMy first hint of a design having soul came back in 2005 when I logged into Flickr for the first time. Sure, Flickr has undergone many, many changes since then, but I’d like to explain how it helped me, as someone who hadn’t shared much online before. I wasn’t sure how to share something, but I noticed right away that the website greeted me with a friendly “Hello.” The website helped me breeze through the process, and the friendly tone was really assuring.\nMy Flickr experience was like a pal gently leading me through the process, making it easy to succeed. It was a warm experience that made me want to return. Incidentally, I can say “hello” in a lot more languages now, thanks to what Flickr taught me.\nMoving forward to newer examples, we can also consider Slack, its competitors and email. All of these options help people communicate, but Slack has a personality that helps you feel more connected with it. Slackbot helps you get started by asking you questions in a conversation, much like a real human would when you meet them for the first time. The makers of Slack eschewed the standard idea of filling in a registration form in favor of something more conversational — this makes other services feel stale and unfriendly by comparison. Slack has soulful flourishes everywhere: from smooth animations to a cute little emoji that is shown when you’ve scrolled all the way to the newest message in your group.\nTo be fair, Slack and Flickr (which, by the way, share cofounders) weren’t the first to try for something more human — that desire has spanned centuries. Lovers of typographic history may recall that Gutenberg wanted the movable type he created to mimic the look of handwriting. He used blackletter-style letters, which were similar to the bible manuscripts that monks illuminated.\nThese examples makes a strong case for design having a soul. The personality that develops from having one is what wins someone’s heart and makes competitors feel like poor (or, at best, passable) copies. Consider this statement by John Medina in “Brain Rules“:\nEmotionally arousing events tend to do better remembered than neutral events… Emotionally charged events persist much longer in our memories and are recalled with greater accuracy than neutral memories.\nIn other words, we’re wired to remember products with a soul. Let’s use that to our advantage.\nNext, let’s get a little more specific and see how that can play out.\nFiddle Factors # One example of a way to give a product a soul is by adding a “fiddle factor.” A fiddle factor is a playful part of a product that imparts a sense of joy or playfulness when used. I first heard this term in Jony Ive’s unofficial biography, Jony Ive: The Genius Behind Apple’s Greatest Products. Ive had a new take on, of all things, a pen. Noticing that people tend to fiddle with their pens when not writing, he added something to his pen design to give people something to play with when they were idle. Of course, Ive started by making the best possible pen, then added the fiddle factor.\nAccording to Clive Grinyer, Ive’s once-boss:\nThis was a new idea back then, to put something on a pen that was purely there to fiddle with. He was really thinking differently. The pen’s design was not just about shape, but also there was an emotional side to it.\nFiddle factors invite people to idly toy with them and form a deeper connection with what you’ve made. They become that warm little blanket that wraps a product around your heart and makes you want it more.\nI’ve described one already with Slack and its emoji use, but here are a few more digital fiddle factors:\nThat pull-to-refresh spinner with the really cool spinning animation? A fiddle factor. That fun animation you click to like something on Twitter? Fiddle factor. In MailChimp, when you find out that Freddy’s arm can extend almost forever when you’re testing an email’s responsive breakpoints? That’s a fiddle factor (albeit a cruel one). One Way to Add a Little Soul to Your Project # To give a project a soul is to cultivate a relationship with it. You need to know what it needs and understand its nature. In this sense, this relationship is the same as a potter with clay or an architect with wood and steel. Once you understand the nature of your materials, you will know what it can become and what its limits are. This will help you to mold a soul in the right ways. Not doing this will ultimately cause your project to feel inauthentic and fail.\nLet’s say you’ve built a playful iOS app. It’s meant to send short, fun replies to friends. In the app, you’ve got an overview page showing the latest emails, and the user can go into a detail view to read a particular message. You could go the standard route of sliding in the email from the right — it’s a simple thing to do, and it’s built right into iOS.\nThe drawback with built-in transitions is well covered: Anyone can use them. Sure, there are definite benefits to them (namely, that they’re cheaper and faster to implement), but it’s difficult to build something that’s soulful if you only use stock components and animation.\nInstead, consider an alternative kind of transition. Think about it like this: Consider the personality you think the app should have. Think about the people who will use this app. I use this chart to help me determine the tone of a project:\nBack to our email app. Let’s say it’s a fun email client. In this chart, it shows most strongly in the casual, energetic and easygoing categories. If we think about the animations we’ll use here, it makes sense to be more playful.\nSo, let’s animate the email message to come up from the bottom of the screen with a little spring in its step. When you’re finished with it, you can swipe it away or pull it back down.\nLet’s take that even further, based on the chart and animation:\nMaybe the animation could be the basis for how you approach other animations in the app. Your other animations could be similarly fun (but don’t overdo it). Maybe it will affect which typefaces you choose. What’s important here is to avoid forcing something in where it doesn’t belong. Don’t be different just for the sake of being different, and don’t overdo it. If we saw the President of the United States deliver the State of the Union address in a Hawaiian shirt, we’d probably feel like something’s amiss and might not take him as seriously as we should. Same here — what we do has to feel natural.\nOther Ideas # Any interaction, be it with a button or a scroll, is a perfect place to explore adding a fiddle factor. Explore what might happen when the user scrolls to the bottom of the content. Or perhaps you could come up with something unexpected when the user hovers over a photo for a long time. Maybe you could make a neat hover or focus animation.\nAdding soul isn’t limited to animation, either. It goes much deeper!\nHow does it sound? Each person’s voice is totally unique, and your product’s should be, too. How does it look? We need to stand out and be ourselves; so do the things we make. How does it act? Could your product know the user on a deeper level and anticipate their needs? That would be deeply soulful. Convincing Your Boss And Team # It’s all well and good for designers to talk about giving their products a soul, but here’s where it gets real: You have a deadline, and a budget. Your boss might not want to go for it, and your engineers might be resistant because it would take them extra time. Let’s talk about a framework for those conversations.\nThe framework I use to have these discussions centers on the effort required to implement an idea and the idea’s impact on the customer and the business.\nWhile there will inevitably be high-impact, high-effort items in a project, the sweet spot is low-effort, high-impact ideas. These types of ideas help the user in meaningful ways, without significantly affecting your timeline and budget.\nThis way of looking at ideas also helps me to let go of ideas that might be a little too egocentric. Those usually have low levels of impact and high levels of effort. Mapping them out in this way helps me to focus on what matters most.\nI’ve found this approach effective because it enables us to differentiate our products, while making the most of our time.\nLet’s go back to custom animations for a moment. If we’re talking about adding fiddle factors and animation to our email app, we can’t build something great by assembling it entirely from off-the-shelf components. If we use only basic components and built-in animations, the product wouldn’t be memorable enough to matter to people. Plus, it will make it difficult for us to fall in love with what we’re building and to give the product a soul.\nOne additional framework to keep in mind is the Kano model, which was developed in the 1980s by Noriaki Kano.\nThere is a great explanation video, but, in short, this model covers three areas:\nbasic needs (Does the product work?), performance needs (How efficient is it?), attractive needs (What makes me love it?). The soul of a product lives in the attractive needs. The Kano model invites us to think of one or two features that set the product apart from its competition. Framing your high-impact, low-effort ideas with this model will help you make a strong case for soul.\nAt our core, we’re people who care about our craft. We want to build great products, and the products need to have those nice touches. Being able to fully ply our trade also helps with employee retention. We’re happier when we’re able to do our best work. If we’re able to fully stretch ourselves to make something great, we’re going to keep giving our best in future. Conversely, if we’re prevented from doing our best work, we’ll become disconnected and disinterested, motivating us to go elsewhere when the opportunity presents itself.\nIf your boss or company doesn’t give you this freedom and you think it’s important, it might be time to plan your next transition.\nWrapping Up # It’s not enough to simply design something and meet a goal. This is a surefire way to burnout and boring products. We’ve got to do more for ourselves, our products and our industry. Finding our principles will help us find the right place to work and to do our best work.\nGiving our products a soul will make them better, more engaging products. The next time you’re designing, ask yourself what would make someone find your product useful, and what would make them care about it more than another product? Once you do that, you’ll be well on your way to cultivating a healthy relationship with your products and building things that people really love.\nAlso, it’s not enough for us to have these ideas; convincing our team members and bosses to come along with us is important. Once we test and articulate the value of what we do, we’ll have a much easier and more rewarding time.\n"},{"id":37,"href":"/docs/published-00009/","title":"Giving Your Product A Soul (Smashing Magazine)","section":"Guides \u0026 Published Articles","content":"Original post\nAfter a few years of designing products for clients, I began to feel fatigued. I wondered why. Turns out, I’d been chasing metric after metric. “Increase those page views!” “Help people spend more time in the app!” And it kept coming. Still, something was missing. I knew that meeting goals was part of what a designer does, but I could see how my work could easily become commoditized and less fulfilling unless something changed.\nI thought of how bored I’d be if I kept on that path. I needed to build some guiding principles that would help me find my place in design. These principles would help grow and would shape my career in a way that fits me best.\nFurther Reading on SmashingMag: # Why Great Products Need Great Collaboration A Lean Approach To Product Validation Nobody Wants To Use Your Product What I’d like to share here is how I found my principles and regained a sense of fulfillment. I’ll also discuss one of them and hopefully convince you that it’s worth considering when we design products. Speaking of convincing, I’d also like to help you convince your boss that these things are important.\nOne small string that began to tie it together was watching Bret Victor’s talk “Inventing on Principle.” The first half is mostly a code demo; then, he gets philosophical and talks about how goals and principles help you. I believe that living by principles can lead you to some really interesting places — for me, they’ve helped me to find the right ways (and places) to work and the right projects to take on (like designing a typeface), and they’ve helped me to identify which areas of my life need to be nurtured so I don’t burn out.\nAdvocate For Design Having A Soul # I’ve worked on projects whose goals varied from increasing email signups by 10% to boosting ad impressions by 30%. It was honest work, to be sure. It’s important that our designs meet the needs of the product owners and our clients — this isn’t art school, and there are real constraints and requirements we need to address.\nHowever, it’s not enough to do metrics-based design. That in itself is a bit too clinical and detached, and where’s the fun in that? We need more.\nValidating and then meeting a project’s requirements should be the minimum of what we set out to do. Once we set those metrics as our baseline, we’re allowed to be more impactful and thoughtful as we get to the root of a design problem.\nWhat we need to shoot for is to help people fall in love with our products. That means pushing to give our designs a soul.\nHere’s what “emotionally connecting” means: It means you’ve created a product that stands out in someone’s heart. The product becomes what people reach for because it’s the most helpful. People might not be able to understand what you’ve done, but they’ll perceive that it’s better. This is one way to make a product that’s indescribably good.\nI usually ask these two questions, which get at part of what helps people fall in love with a product:\nWhat’s going to help someone really find this useful? What’s going to make them care about it? For years, we’ve focused on making our websites and products be functional, reliable and usable. These qualities are the bedrock of any good product, but it’s when we add a soul to a product that it really comes alive.\nMy first hint of a design having soul came back in 2005 when I logged into Flickr for the first time. Sure, Flickr has undergone many, many changes since then, but I’d like to explain how it helped me, as someone who hadn’t shared much online before. I wasn’t sure how to share something, but I noticed right away that the website greeted me with a friendly “Hello.” The website helped me breeze through the process, and the friendly tone was really assuring.\nMy Flickr experience was like a pal gently leading me through the process, making it easy to succeed. It was a warm experience that made me want to return. Incidentally, I can say “hello” in a lot more languages now, thanks to what Flickr taught me.\nMoving forward to newer examples, we can also consider Slack, its competitors and email. All of these options help people communicate, but Slack has a personality that helps you feel more connected with it. Slackbot helps you get started by asking you questions in a conversation, much like a real human would when you meet them for the first time. The makers of Slack eschewed the standard idea of filling in a registration form in favor of something more conversational — this makes other services feel stale and unfriendly by comparison. Slack has soulful flourishes everywhere: from smooth animations to a cute little emoji that is shown when you’ve scrolled all the way to the newest message in your group.\nTo be fair, Slack and Flickr (which, by the way, share cofounders) weren’t the first to try for something more human — that desire has spanned centuries. Lovers of typographic history may recall that Gutenberg wanted the movable type he created to mimic the look of handwriting. He used blackletter-style letters, which were similar to the bible manuscripts that monks illuminated.\nThese examples makes a strong case for design having a soul. The personality that develops from having one is what wins someone’s heart and makes competitors feel like poor (or, at best, passable) copies. Consider this statement by John Medina in “Brain Rules“:\nEmotionally arousing events tend to do better remembered than neutral events… Emotionally charged events persist much longer in our memories and are recalled with greater accuracy than neutral memories.\nIn other words, we’re wired to remember products with a soul. Let’s use that to our advantage.\nNext, let’s get a little more specific and see how that can play out.\nFiddle Factors # One example of a way to give a product a soul is by adding a “fiddle factor.” A fiddle factor is a playful part of a product that imparts a sense of joy or playfulness when used. I first heard this term in Jony Ive’s unofficial biography, Jony Ive: The Genius Behind Apple’s Greatest Products. Ive had a new take on, of all things, a pen. Noticing that people tend to fiddle with their pens when not writing, he added something to his pen design to give people something to play with when they were idle. Of course, Ive started by making the best possible pen, then added the fiddle factor.\nAccording to Clive Grinyer, Ive’s once-boss:\nThis was a new idea back then, to put something on a pen that was purely there to fiddle with. He was really thinking differently. The pen’s design was not just about shape, but also there was an emotional side to it.\nFiddle factors invite people to idly toy with them and form a deeper connection with what you’ve made. They become that warm little blanket that wraps a product around your heart and makes you want it more.\nI’ve described one already with Slack and its emoji use, but here are a few more digital fiddle factors:\nThat pull-to-refresh spinner with the really cool spinning animation? A fiddle factor. That fun animation you click to like something on Twitter? Fiddle factor. In MailChimp, when you find out that Freddy’s arm can extend almost forever when you’re testing an email’s responsive breakpoints? That’s a fiddle factor (albeit a cruel one).

It’s a short-term solution that helps us stay dry while we try to get indoors to safety.\nHow we can filter replies # The core of this idea is that anyone could mention you, share or like your updates, but you don’t see every reply. They’re not always visible because you’ve got a filter that’s hiding certain replies.\nHow it works: you specify which types of replies get through (we’ll get to that in a moment), and the rest go to an “other” reply screen which can totally be ignored.\nHere’s what that could look like:\nFriends only # You’ve got a public account and people can see your posts. But you only see interactions from people you’ve approved.\nAnyone can request permission to interact with you. Those requests are ranked by who’s in your contacts. So, if a friend you know wants to come hang out with you: cool, they’re at the top of the request list so you don’t miss them.\nFriends of friends # This allows for a little more exposure. You’re good at choosing friends, and you figure that your friends are, too. So they can totally interact with you.\nVerified accounts only # This is relatively new and pretty interesting. Twitter just opened up public registration for verified accounts, and it could have some interesting repercussions later on down the line.\nOn Twitter, you could opt into allowing replies from everyone who’s verified their account. This means they’re effectively taking responsibility for what they’re saying and doing online, and screwing up could mean their account gets suspended, banned, or they’ve got some other action taken against them. I think this could help everyone and make a serious dent in who experiences harassment in their replies.\nDrawbacks\nThere’s a drawback to this approach: some people want to keep their information private and may not want to verify their accounts. And that’s totally their prerogative.\nIf a you enable this feature, your engagements could decrease. If you’re the social network, you care about this. If you’re a human who’s getting harassed, you care, like, none percent about this.\nI’d argue that just as it’s your right to keep your information private and not have your account verified, it’d also be another person’s right to only allow replies from verified users.\nI say that because some want Twitter to be like a backyard bbq where they hang out with just their friends (and maybe have other people looking on as spectators). Some want Twitter to be a completely open space where any opinion should be able to fly. Still others want a more measured experience. Why can’t we have people opting into whichever one fits them best?\nOther ideas that need work # One of my favorite Twitter clients, Tweetbot, allows me to mute things. And I mute a lot. I wonder how it could factor into this solution.\nWord-based filters are easy to circumvent. They also disallow legitimate uses of certain words and mostly amount to an arms race — see the billions of spam emails people get about how great v1@gr@ is.\nPerhaps we could utilize machine learning to look for variants of those words and understand the context of a message. If we’re going back to the idea of who you let interact with you, we could limit use of those words to your friends.\nYeah, but free speech! # I don’t want to retread all those arguments here, but mostly my thoughts align with this Xkcd comic. In short, I think that if what’s being said is deliberately hateful or harassing, it shouldn’t ever be permitted.\nI think what’s helpful about filtering replies allows for a level of discourse you’re comfortable with. It also lets most other conversations go on unaffected.\nIt’s fair to argue that this doesn’t solve the root of the problem: people are still saying and doing terrible things, which have terrible consequences for those on the receiving end. I’d love to dive into that issue and tackle it, but it’s tremendously complex and there’s no way one post could solve it.\nClosing thoughts # Harassment is a tricky one to solve, particularly if your network is built in such a way that doesn’t have the guardrails in place to inhibit it from the start. Fixing harassment is more than could be discussed in one single post, and should be the ultimate long-term goal.\nI don’t know what that solution looks like exactly, but I do know we need to build safeguards and a community of people that don’t tolerate harassment. Whatever that solution is, I’d love to be a part of it.\nSurprise by Danil Polshin, Speech Bubble by Anna Stem from the Noun Project\n"},{"id":39,"href":"/docs/published-00026/","title":"Tips for perfect readability with a little help from The Big Lebowski","section":"Guides \u0026 Published Articles","content":"Original post\nI’ve had lots of conversations about typography over the last few years. Which is cool, because I love it so much (so much that I decided to make my own typeface). It’s exciting to see so many designers caring about making a beautiful group of letters that people want to read.\nOne common theme I see in these conversations is how to get the best readability with text. We usually end up talking about serif vs sans serif, line height, line spacing, and other tricks. I’d like to share some of them with you here.\nThese ideas aren’t prescriptions or laws, nor should they be perceived as such—they’re only guidelines to help you think about what works best for your design.\nLine length # If you’ve ever gotten tired from reading a paragraph, it could be because the length isn’t right. The best thing to do is keep your line lengths between 50–75 characters. This helps your eye easily scan what’s in a paragraph without getting tired.\nAnything longer than 75 characters increases the chances you’ll re-read a paragraph. Shorter widths will find you losing the train of thought as you jump from line to line.\nSo, when is it best to 50 characters rather than 75? I look at it like this: between 16 and 42pt text, you can go closer to 75 characters. For type sized outside those bounds, I stay closer to 50 characters.\nLine length is an important factor to consider when it comes to responsive design. I’ve seen many sites which forget about how phones or larger screens will handle text. That leads to a poor reading experience — leaving the text to fill the available area without thought to how wide a line is hurts the reading experience.\nLine height # Another factor affecting readability is the spacing between lines. It’s known by a few names: line height, leading, or line spacing. When discussing line height, I separate it out in two parts: headlines and everything else.\nI’ve found I have the most impactful headlines if I use 90–110% line height. This helps a short burst of text have the oomph it needs without feeling too airy. It also makes headlines feel more tightly connected if they wrap to another line. If you’re working with CSS, avoid using pixels for this and let it be relative to the type size. I set it like this: h1{line-height: 1.1;}\nFor regular text, you’ll want to consider a line height that’s 120–160% of the font size. This helps your lines have adequate breathing room. Too much and your paragraph begins to look like distinctly separate lines. Too little and your characters will touch each other from line to line.\nIdeally, your text should read like a nice, big grey box when you squint at it (or apply a blur to it). If it looks more like individual lines or a darker block of text, you’ve probably got a line height problem.\nThese percentage ranges give you a baseline to work with for your typography. Each typeface is different, and what you choose won’t be the same every time.\nText size and hierarchy # It’s good to have a system when you make text. A system helps you make better, more strategic decisions when you’re adding new elements to your design.\nTo get one started, think about the text that’ll be the most plentiful in your design — base everything else off of that. You’re probably going to have lots of paragraphs in your designs, so I usually start there. Next, think about other elements: headers, subheaders, etc. Once I have them, I usually like to plug my designs into something called Modular Scale to help build a hierarchy.\nModular Scale uses the concept of musical scales to help build a hierarchy. Just like scales help bring harmony to a piece of music, having a typographic system keeps everything in sync as you add new elements.\nMost of my designs start out with 16pt as a base, because anything smaller tends to be tougher to read. If I’m designing for iOS, I start at 17pt because that’s what iOS sets as the default. It’s weird to me, but [shrug emoji].\nIt’s not about serif vs sans serif # The debate over serif or sans serif being more readable has gone on for a long time. Like, decades. Alex Poole has a nice meta-summary of serif vs sans serif arguments which articulates arguments from both sides (with research!). Given that, I choose to reframe the debate and think about something else: contrast.\nIf you’re unfamiliar with how contrast applies here: it refers to the balance between the thick and thin strokes in a character. (We’ll talk about color contrast in a moment).\nJust like with photos, you’ll want to have enough contrast make out what you’re seeing easily. Too much in a photo and everything looks like a blown-out 90s album cover, too little and you can’t make out a thing.\nLook at Helvetica on the top, and Didot below it. Notice the difference in the stroke around E. Helvetica has a much lower contrast since the stroke is largely the same. Didot has much more contrast. Both are usually good for headlines since those are short and don’t require significant effort to read.\nIncidentally, this is where Helvetica falls down — its low contrast and (nearly) uniform stroke aren’t the best for long-form text. I still don’t swoon for it in headlines, but it’s definitely got some utility.\nFor me, something with decent contrast is nice. Avenir works great for reading, as do Tisa and Georgia. Many type families have versions specifically for headlines and specifically for reading, too. Go try them out!\nColor contrast # Last, but certainly not least is about the color you choose. It doesn’t matter how great your type choice, or if you’ve done everything else in this post: people have to be able to see the text you’re giving them to read.\nMake sure your text’s contrast meets one of these two WCAG’s contrast levels:\nLevel AA, which is 4.5:1 for text below 18pt, 3:1 for 18pt and larger Level AAA, which is 7:1 for text below 18pt, 4.5:1 for 18pt and larger There’s a neat plugin for Sketch and other apps have similar plugins to help you get the right contrast. Level AA and AAA ensure folks with vision issues can still read your text without problems. Some may find this limiting, but I find this liberating—I know if I choose something with adequate contrast that anyone can read it without issue.\nSometimes a client will have you using colors which aren’t within those guidelines. When that happens, we should tell our clients so and recommend a close approximation that matches their brand standards. If you’re lucky, it’s not their primary brand color causing a problem.\nIn closing # This is by no means an exhaustive discussion of how to get the best readability with text, but it should help you along the way. I’m considering writing more about typography and readability, so please leave me a comment on what you’d like me to look into.\nAlso: if you’re looking to learn more about typography, get Ellen Lupton’s excellent Thinking with Type. Or Jason Santa Maria’s On Web Typography. I have a bookshelf full of nerdy reading material on this subject, but those are two of my favorites.\nHappy typing!\n"},{"id":40,"href":"/docs/published-00030/","title":"Why I pulled a HULK SMASH on my social media presence","section":"Guides \u0026 Published Articles","content":"Original post\nI’ve had this feeling that the amount of brainspace that social media occupied was out of balance for me.\nI found myself in a problematic situation more often that I’d like: checking social media during every bit of downtime, or when I was trying to solve a particularly difficult design problem.

It also talks about what’s being lost in our ever-connected haze of communication: the ability to think deeply.\nThere’s a section which talks about how social media should factor into your life, or even if it should at all. I’m still thinking about its implications. The book suggests you start by making some personal goals, which I am in a constant state of refining. After you’ve made them, see if social media provides enough benefit to offset the time and attention drag associated with them.\nMy goals require these networks to be the best way of doing two things. One: helping me become the best designer possible. And two: connecting with people I can’t see every day. If they turn out to not meet those goals, I’ll leave or significantly reduce my time investment in them. I’m bearish on the first goal, but more hopeful about the second.\nHow I did it # I started with trying to selectively unfollow people. I just couldn’t though. More than once, I sat down to try and found nothing but decision fatigue awaited every time. Everyone on my list mattered in some way and it was difficult to let it go. So I just paid someone to do it for me.\nI had them move everyone to a list I’ll check (weekly, probably), and unfollow everyone. This leaves my timeline free to gradually rebuild a list of daily follows which help me meet the goals I mentioned earlier.\nWith Twitter, I’m using Tweetbot because of its excellent filtering capabilities. It’s helpful because sometimes I want to follow a person, but don’t care about everything they tweet. Your mileage may vary, but here’s what I’m filtering:\nPolitics (specifically mentions of any candidate’s names, related hashtags, etc.) Any check-in (beer apps, foursquare) Apps that auto-post from WordPress or other blogs Time-wasting sites Character names for shows that I don’t want spoiled I may end up filtering all links and moving to Nuzzel, which aggregates popular links in my feeds. Still unsure about that.\nI’m not saying I don’t consume any of these types of content, but I don’t think I want to get it from this medium. Except for whatever @dogsolutions posts. I will like and probably retweet everything until the day I die. If you don’t like that: FIGHT ME.\nI’m also checking in less frequently. A weekly check-in on Facebook, 2x daily on Twitter. That lets me post and reply and feels like a good balance.\nOverall, I’d love for these services to give me more granular control over the things I see. They need our time and attention to keep growing and survive, but I only have so much to give.\nDirect messages and other things # People can message me and it’s treated like any other incoming communication. I’ll get to it eventually, but not immediately.\nI don’t get notifications about likes, follows, or any of that.\nI also dumped the apps because I check them too frequently.\nThe last thing I did was to put on blinders when I go to these sites. I used my browser’s ability to load custom stylesheets and made one that hides things which cause me to wander around too much. So if it’s troublesome, I find it in the code and set it to display:none. Poof, problem gone!\nWhat’d it do for me? # I was surprised at what happened. In the time I’ve been away, I was able to research and begin drawing a new typeface. This process had previously taken me months, and now I had the focus to do it in weeks. I also wrote a new article (not including this one). Additionally, I was able to contribute to some really heavy, thinky things at my job. This wouldn’t have been possible with social media checks every minute.\nI’ve also benefitted greatly from the downtime by having a general sense of lightness and playfulness. I’ve felt less stressed and finally feel like my brain has some space to stretch.\nOne of the biggest surprises was how it helped my relationship with my wife. Since we’ve both been spending more time with each other (she read the book and quit social media for a while, too), we’ve talked more and I feel more connected than I have in years.\nIn closing # I got here after lots of (over)thinking, but it seems like this is going to work for me. I’m still working out my goals, which feel like the key to how I interact online. But overall, I think I’m moving in the right direction. It’s my hope that sharing this can give you some insights on moving forward yourself. If you find any new strategies, I’d love to hear them.\n"},{"id":41,"href":"/docs/published-00018/","title":"My week with Soylent 1.4, or “Oh god I want a burger”","section":"Guides \u0026 Published Articles","content":"Original post\n💡 I wrote this article in 2015. While I like that I was curious, I want to be clear in that I absolutely do not recommend this kind of stuff. Also, it’s fun to note that everything from this era is basically a clickbait style headline. Ugh. I’m always curious about how changing a habit will affect me and have little aversion to change. My main apps for email, search, and anything else get regularly switched, and so do my mobile OSes. I quit (or double!) caffeine intake. I think that in doing so, I’m cultivating a personality that thrives on learning and change. So when Soylent hit my radar, I was excited to see what it’d do for me.\nIf you’re curious about Soylent, here’s their website. It’s basically that liquid meal Neo eats on the Nebuchadnezzar in The Matrix. Soylent has all the calories and nutrients you’d need to be healthy. A Science Happy Meal, basically.\nSome background on me # I’ve been an active guy for the last few years. 5x weekly workouts, I’m a vegetarian of a 2.5 years, and eat fairly healthy. Mostly greens, and I meet the recommended protein intake for folks like me. I tracked things heavily at first through Jawbone’s UP and MyFitnessPal, enough to get an idea of my diet. I did fine, and it’d bore you to death if I got into that here.\nWhat I wanted to learn # Would it help me get more willpower to resist things that were bad for me? I’m terrible with sweets and fear diabetes and cavities.\nHow would food affect my cognitive ability? My diet makes me foggy in the afternoon sometimes, and it would be super to be able to devote more time to solving problems.\nWould I become leaner and weigh less? I’m not overweight, but I wonder if this would be a signal for how well I’m doing with my current diet.\nWillpower # Me in real life.\nDude, if you put me up with basically any kind of sweet, I will pound it down (Pop Rocks are my drug of choice, by the way). That’s kind of scary and I don’t want to be beholden to that kind of addiction.\nLuckily, the week was rife with willpower tests. A friend brought in homemade strawberry rhubarb pop tarts with frosting the day after I started. Read that again: HOMEMADE. STRAWBERRY. POP. TARTS. There were lots of other sweets throughout the week, including free ice cream (I should also state that my religious affiliation could probably be Americone Dream). I successfully avoided all sweets. Every one of them. I wonder if it was because I knew I was getting everything I needed with Soylent.\nEither way, that was an incredible win. I would use this to help me break food addictions.\nCognitive ability # Important: always feed and water yourself, else you become a hangry Hulk.\nIn the afternoon, I’ll usually get a little foggy. With Soylent, I was able to talk through any problem at any point in the day, even before lunch when people usually get hangry. And I can achieve Hulk-levels of hanger if not fed and watered properly, so I’m keen on avoiding that if at all possible. Even late into the evening, my brain was as sharp as it was earlier in the day.\nThis category was a total win.\nWeight, etc. # I thought that I might see a reduction with my weight or body fat percentage. I realize I had a small sample size of a week here, but it isn’t unusual for me to weigh 1-3 pounds lighter on Monday than I did on Friday.\nNope, everything stayed exactly the same. Maybe I’d see more with longer usage. I wasn’t disappointed though.\nWhat else I noticed # This dog is my spirit animal.\nGod, I missed food. By day 3, I laid awake dreaming of a burger. Or a pizza. Or anything that I could chew and enjoy that didn’t look like a ground-up beige PC tower (just where do they go when you throw them out? Tell me! You can’t prove to me that I’m not eating one!).\nI had planned in advance to allow myself a meal a few 5 days in. And let me tell you, that was one of the most amazing veggie burgers I’d ever had. I tasted every little bit of flavor that they baked into it. I probably cried a little out of joy.\nAlso, I could not get enough water. Drinking 8–10 glasses a day wasn’t enough. It had other consequences that were…unpleasant. It made any bathroom time weird because towards the end of my experiment I was backed up. I kept Gas-X with me along the way, because I had a lot of it. And it was foul.\nWhat’s next # Soylent, overall, is a concept I like in small quantities. It won’t be replacing 3 meals a day for me, though. I think it’s likely I’ll keep it for breakfast and maybe a lunch during the week. It makes me feel pretty great, and I look at it as a tool to help me be a better thinker and problem solver. I’m so glad I tried it.\nJust writing this makes me want a burger. So, thanks for reading, I’m out to get one.\n"},{"id":42,"href":"/docs/published-00023/","title":"Requiem for a side project, quitting AwesomeGIFs","section":"Guides \u0026 Published Articles","content":"Original post\nA feeling came over me in 2009 when GeoCities was shutting down: ‘I don’t want all those GIFs to somehow disappear! They’re magic.’ So I made a home for them, and in the span of a few short weeks, AwesomeGIFs was born.\nPowered by the humble WordPress, it operated like so many blogs of its time, publishing new GIFs each day. I loved those misfit GIFs so much — they turned out to be so much more fun than I’d ever imagine, and it warmed me to see so many people take to them like they did.\nAwesomeGIFs hit several highlights in its time. It became a go-to for Reddit users, a constant feature with StumbleUpon, and a powerhouse for search rankings. It paid my car payment and could float my business needs. It even got an app! Perhaps the biggest achievement: people knew and loved my project. I would meet new people, the site would come up in conversation, and they’d tell me a variation on how happy it made them. It would make my heart sing every single time. AwesomeGIFs was rewarding in every way you’d want a side project to be.\nIt was beset with several challenges, namely when my hosting company disabled my entire account without notice for being too popular. Since I hosted AwesomeGIFs on the same server along with my business and personal sites, I was gonna flip if they did it again. They did, incidentally.\nThere was also a fun time where I moved my image hosting to Amazon S3. It was blazing fast and my host stopped complaining, but I ended up with a massive bill, so I had to find other options. I finally settled in Digital Ocean’s happy waters, where the site currently lives.\nUltimately, the site and I grew apart. I thought of trying new things with it, but found my interest going in other directions. This continued while the site remained neglected. Some things began to fail on my server and I wasn’t able to fix it on my own, and so my happiness with the project began to wane.\nGiving myself permission to quit # I read a post on The Pastry Box on No More Forever Projects that helped give form to some of my feelings, specifically one that gave me permission to quit projects. One particuarly liberating quote:\n“The half-life of obligation is short; the half-life of guilt is long”\nIt’s true. The guilt I felt for neglecting a side project pricked me with little knives every so often, so I knew I had to do something. I decided to sit on it for a few months and come back to it to see if there was anything left for me here. There wasn’t, turns out.\nSo, I’m officially letting AwesomeGIFs go. It’ll live on for a while so folks can continue to enjoy the GIFs, but I’m focusing on other things. Maybe someone will want to pick up the torch. I won’t say the site won’t ever be resurrected, but I’m finished updating it. I want to move onto other things without worrying about this one.\nI’ve learned that my future projects should start with an end in mind, or at least a time to reevaluate if I want to continue going. It feels so freeing to not commit to something in perpetuity.\nWe had a great run together, AwesomeGIFs, and I hope all my side projects can be as wonderful as you were. Thanks.\n"},{"id":43,"href":"/docs/published-00021/","title":"Prototyping iOS And Android Apps With Sketch (Smashing Magazine)","section":"Guides \u0026 Published Articles","content":"Original post\nAfter the untimely (and still kind of sad) demise of Fireworks, I found myself looking for other ways to design apps and websites. I also had the desire to produce something more interactive for when I talk about my work with stakeholders. It turned out that Sketch, when paired with some other neat tools, would be a big part of this workflow.\nIn this article, I’ll talk you through why you should prototype and how you can do it with Sketch and prototyping tools such as Flinto and InVision. You’ll also get a nicely documented freebie Sketch file to help you.\nGetting The Sketch Workflow Right: Meet “The Sketch Handbook” Sketch With Material Design Using Sketch For Responsive Web Design (A Case Study) Before we get started, here are a few articles, in case you‘re curious about why I am using Sketch for UI design:\n“Design Tools for Today’s Web,” Anthony Colangelo “Fireworks Refugees! Welcome to the Open Arms of Sketch 3,” Adam Howell “Discovering Sketch,” Jean-Marc Denis Why Prototype? # When it comes to showing an app’s design to a team, a client or a stakeholder, I’ve found that an ugly-but-functional prototype beats the static bitmap of one state of a screen that I’d get from Sketch, Photoshop or the like. I’ve found that communicating things like user flow and hierarchy is tougher in static mockups (especially when dealing with responsive websites, but that’s a topic for another day).\nIncreasingly, animation is playing a stronger role in design. I like how Val Head puts it in “All the Right Moves: Putting Your UIs in Motion” (emphasis mine):\nMotion has meaning in UX design\nMotion provides meaning and is also central to the functioning of all native mobile apps — and increasingly for the web as well (see “Material Design” and the Polymer project from Google). So, it’s critical to prototype for and to show motion and animation for all digital design work, but especially for mobile apps.\nSide note: You can create pretty robust interactive prototypes right in Adobe Fireworks, including mobile prototypes, web prototypes and iOS prototypes. However, since Fireworks won’t be further developed by Adobe, finding an alternative workflow was vital for me.\nI’ve tried several methods of showing mockups to clients. There are a ton of them, and so many look amazing. I ended up trying flat images, clickable PDF wireframes and even prototypes built in Interface Builder. Here’s how they worked out:\nFlat images left people wondering how we’d ever get to SuperAmazingFeature 3000™. This surely wasn’t the right way to go. Clickable PDF wireframes upset the scale of our designs by fitting the PDF to whatever size my screen was — clearly, not the right way, either. (There is a way in Adobe Acrobat to specify the zoom level of a page that is the destination of a link within a PDF file so that all pages have a consistent zoom level. But if you do not create the links carefully, then you will need to manually change the zoom level and scroll point on the destination page, because Acrobat usually sets the zoom level for each page to maximize the view of that page, and app screens and web pages often have different lengths and will be displayed at different zoom levels.) Interface Builder (part of Xcode) is fun, although it comes with a considerable learning curve and investment of time compared to the others. Not everyone designs on Mac OS X or for iOS, either. While things built in Interface Builder showed animations, neither flat images nor clickable PDFs did. That’s a bummer, because animation communicates what a flat image can’t: transitions, which are another critical part of good design. Here’s an example of why animation is key: That really cool alert you designed to slide up from the bottom of the screen will most likely get lost in a flat mockup. If you can show it animating in, you’re more likely to get your point across to someone.\nIt wasn’t until recently that I found a happy medium: building a wireframe kit and making interactive prototypes in services such as Flinto and InVision. I’ve been able to create designs that people view in context, on their devices and on their time. I’ve found that context is important: Showing a screenshot of a mobile app on someone’s computer invites confusion, and we generally want to avoid that.\nFlinto has a 30-day trial, while InVision offers a free tier that works with one project. Both have paid plans with more features.\nIn keeping with the idea of staying lean, I adapted a wireframe kit for iOS (I’m still working on the Android bit!), so that people can focus on structure rather than pixels. I did get a couple of folks asking if that’s how the app would look, but most understood the concept pretty well. I use the metaphor of building a house: Wireframes are the foundation of the house, and painting and moving in the furniture come after we’ve ordered everything just right.\nLet’s talk a little about the freebie Sketch file next.\nThe Sketch Blueprint File # The iOS 7 Blueprint.sketch template file is free to use (I put it under the MIT license), and is intended to help you focus on making interactive prototypes.\nSketch Blueprint (ZIP file, 1.5 MB) Sketch Blueprint, GitHub Please note that the template requires Sketch version 3.1+. (The folks at Bohemian Coding changed Sketch’s file format in that version, and versions older than 3.1 won’t be able to open the file correctly.)\nI’ve included several elements to get you started:\ntab bar, menu bar, segmented controller, search bar, tables (with and without icons), images of varying proportions, alerts, various buttons and icons. You’ll also find linked color and text styles, so you can color and style it as you see fit.\nThe Sketch file has even been updated for the latest iPhones, 6 and 6 Plus, so it should be up to date as of the publication of this article.\nI thought about what the color scheme could be and considered reverting to a grayscale gamma, but that felt too flat to me. Then, I thought more about blueprints and how I use that metaphor when talking about building designs, and I decided to go with the monochromatic blue palette.\nNote: You can also download the sample Sketch Blueprint file that I used to build the demo prototype shown in this article, complete with pages and artboards and ready for exporting. You may wonder why I have two Sketch files? My plan is to regularly update the GitHub-hosted Sketch Blueprint file for new mobile devices, and I’m providing the other file in the hope that it is useful to you (although I won’t be maintaining it after this article is published), because you could learn more from it about pages and artboards and how to set up slices for easy image exporting.\nHow I Organize My Sketch App Files # I use a separate page in Sketch for each section. Let’s say we’re talking about a log-in screen. I’ll give each variation of the log-in screen (registration, lost password, incorrect password, etc.) its own artboard. If I’m making an app that requires a log-in or sign-up process, I’ll put the log-in view on its own page with each state (like showing registration and error states).\nSpeaking of all of those views, you’ll find it helpful to name your artboards, especially when you export them. Your naming conventions will probably vary, and maybe your team already has one. If not, here’s how I name my pages and artboards, by following a page name – artboard name convention.\nLog In – Main Log In – Sign Up Log In – Forgot Password Log In – Error I try to use symbols for repeating elements such as menu bars, images and icons when designing these views. It makes life easier because I can change a symbol once and see its instances update everywhere.\nNote: Are you new to Sketch? Learn the basics of artboards, layers, pages, groups, symbols and styles (resources that are part of the official documentation).\nSketch also lets you do this with colors, buttons and text styles, which is neat. I can create one style for headlines, body copy and subheadings that will link throughout every other screen in the document. If I change the color in one spot, every other element that shares the style will be updated. Not having to make the same update manually in 20 other places is nice.\nNote: I’ll draw a quick parallel with Adobe Fireworks. Symbols and styles in Sketch work similarly to the way they do in Fireworks, so the concept should be easy to understand. This topic has been covered in depth in the following articles on Smashing Magazine:\n“Collaborating With Adobe Fireworks on Large Design Teams,” Dan Nisbet “How to Make an Effective Style Guide With Adobe Fireworks,” Joshua Mauldin “iOS Prototyping With TAP and Adobe Fireworks,” Shlomo Goltz “Useful Fireworks Techniques and Features for Large Design Teams,” Kris Niles Fireworks doesn’t have the artboards feature, but it does have pages just like Sketch. So, moving from one app to the other shouldn’t be very hard for experienced Fireworks users.\nAlso, note that symbols in Sketch aren’t 100% the same as they are in Adobe Fireworks. Fireworks has both symbols and rich symbols. Rich symbols in Fireworks allow a symbol’s instance properties to be edited independently — this means that you can make changes to the instances of a rich symbol without affecting the master symbol. This is a very useful feature for designing user interfaces — think of a button with multiple states, for example, or a text label that you can edit without affecting the design of the UI element itself.\nSketch, on the other hand, doesn’t have the concept of states inside a symbol (yet), so be cautious if you’re trying to make a button with multiple states; in this case, breaking your active and inactive states into separate symbols is probably best.\nExporting Into My Prototyping Tool Of Choice # For this example, I’ll use Flinto. It isn’t the only option out there (I’ll review a few other prototyping solutions later in the article), but it sure is simple. And super-speedy, too.\nUsing slices in Sketch is easy, and you can export everything as a PNG or JPG to the desktop and drag those files right into Flinto. (Alternatively, you can click on your artboard’s name on the canvas and choose “Make Exportable,” define the export optimization settings and export the images.)\nLinking the exported images together in Flinto is easy, as is keeping parts fixed to the top or bottom of the window; for example, you can place a fixed menu bar at the top and a toolbar at the bottom. More on that in a moment.\nWhen I’m finished with my design, I’ll create a new project in Flinto and use the iPhone 6 Plus with a white transparent menu bar. In our case, I’ve been dragging my files from the desktop in the order that I want them presented. I’ll make my menu bar fixed, as well as the tab bar.\nIf you need, you can also fix elements to the top and bottom of the page. Just drag these icons down to your desired placement.\nFlinto will create an interactive prototype in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You’ll receive a link via email or SMS to add it to your device’s home screen, and it will look and feel like a real app. Flinto allows you to have the standard transitions of iOS and Android (iOS has a few more than Android does at this point, but they’re all there!). Flinto doen’t support Windows Phone, though.\nThis is awesome because it lets designers who might not have experience with Xcode or responsive frameworks such as Twitter’s Bootstrap or Zurb’s Foundation to communicate their ideas and user flows more clearly than by sharing a simple flat image.\nIf you’re making a responsive website, you could argue that getting into HTML is the way to go, and I wouldn’t necessarily disagree. It’s up to you to find out the right approach for your project and team.\nSome Handy Tips And Tricks # You can show screens for a certain amount of time, like you would an alert or tooltip. This is helpful if you want to show an alert view that pops up for a short amount of time.\nFlinto also lets you duplicate links from one screen to another, which is super-helpful. Just drag the hotspot that you made on one screen on top of the next. Voilà!\nBefore looking at our prototype, let’s take a peek at the workspace. You should see some of the things we discussed, like where the fixed menu bars and tab bars live, as well as how the link groups look.\nNow for the fun part: previewing! Let’s give it a shot. Here’s a screen recording of what it looks like on my iPhone:\nhttps://vimeo.com/114618884\nHey, that looks pretty nice! We’re ready to show it to other people and get feedback to move forward.\nOne other neat thing is that you don’t have to create a new project once you’re ready to add more design elements — you can keep building it up and changing it as the design evolves. If you’re using the same Sketch file, then you’ll be able to replace the images in your current prototype with higher-fidelity ones; export those artboards from Sketch and drag them into the editor. And if you want to keep it, you could simply duplicate your current project by going to “Settings” → “Actions” → “Duplicate This Prototype.”\nOther Prototyping Tools # I mentioned earlier that Flinto isn’t the only prototyping service on the market. In fact, there are too many of them! Before I settled on my Sketch and Flinto workflow, I explored a few alternatives.\nThere’s InVision, which is absolutely lovely. You can prototype a design in a similar way to Flinto, from phone-sized all the way up to desktop-sized. It has a free tier (Yay!), and it offers native support for Sketch files. It also offers gesture support, so you can show people what happens when a user swipes through to the next screen. You can also have fixed headers and footers and a web app that users can install on their devices. It’s pretty neat.\nAnother thing I enjoy about InVision is that you can add comments directly on a design, so there’s no confusion about whom feedback is coming from.\nI recently also looked closely into one other tool, Pixate, which is made specifically for iOS and Android apps. It gives you a lot more control over animation and gestures. I like it because it allows a designer to show more realistic interactions than Flinto or InVision. Say you have a table that you’d like to scroll horizontally, but you want the rest of the screen to remain static. Pixate lets you get that deep when creating the prototype, which is neat. (A terrific demo video that you should watch is on its website.)\nThere’s also the good old Interface Builder. It’s part of Xcode (a Mac-only tool), and it allows you to prototype iOS apps — as well as Apple Watch apps as a matter of fact (but that’s a discussion for another time). Interface Builder has got a considerably steeper learning curve, but it will produce higher-quality results than Flinto and InVision. Keep in mind that Interface Builder will make an app prototype that runs directly on an iOS device.\nIf you need to prototype for iOS specifically, you could also use Keynote, because it includes nearly all of the native transitions and animations in iOS, and it’s easy to drop in bitmap images and some live text to create something that behaves like your intended design. Its limitation is that it can make prototypes only for iOS (no Android or Windows Phone support).\nIt’s worth noting here that most of these prototyping tools require the use of flat images and/or slices, and they do not generate any code or framework for a responsive website. The prototypes they create have certain limitations and are intended for discussion only (although Interface Builder could be taken a little further in making an app).\nHere’s a table comparing some of the prototyping apps that I’ve tried and their features:\nProduct Ease of use Platforms Animation support Gesture support Comments Interface Builder Difficult iOS OS, custom Yes No Flinto Easy iOS, Android OS No No Pixate Moderate iOS, Android OS, custom Yes No InVision Easy iOS, Android, web OS Yes Yes Conclusion # I hope this article has persuaded you to start experimenting with prototypes (if you haven’t already). Something interactive will almost always communicate more than a picture ever could, and you’ll have better conversations because of it. On the other hand, Sketch is an excellent UI design tool, lightweight and quite powerful, and it works great with Flinto, InVision and the like because they live in the borderlands of flat images and HTML or native code; this approach lets you whip up something to discuss in minutes. Prototyping services like these are lightweight enough to help you if you can’t code a prototype yourself.\nIf you have questions, let me know in the comments!\nFurther Reading # “UX Tools,” User Experience Design Resources Some great resources on prototyping options.

After all, it wouldn’t be Star Trek if you only had Kirk — you need Spock to balance him out (and it’d be kind of boring if it were just Spock, right?).\nSpock and Kirk work together and solve difficult problems. One’s driven by logic, the other by empathy and the heart. This relationship feels like a good template for how designers and engineers could work together because one working independently wouldn’t be nearly as effective or interesting as both working together. Oh, FYI: you’ll end up playing both Spock and Kirk during the course of a project.\nWork closely by staying on the bridge with each other. # Show an engineer your sketches, ideas, and prototypes before you send them out. Make sure you two join the kickoff meeting so everyone can think of ways to solve the problem at hand. That way, your engineer can start to think about how to solve the problem from their end, help avoid any pitfalls, and put forward some other interesting ideas to shape the project.\nConsider that you’re both designing something. # Design is more than looks, it’s how it works. The sooner both people know what they’re doing, the better. It’s like building a house—engineers put the foundation and plumbing in place, designers work out the house’s layout and interior. You’re going to want to keep in close contact so it’s clear what you’re presenting can actually be built. This house wouldn’t be much if it looked amazing but no one had running water.\nDesigners: be specific in your intentions. # Let’s think about designing a button that submits a form. You’ve got a lot in your head: the button color, the animation that happens when you interact with it, where the user goes once it’s pressed. Your engineer pal shouldn’t have to guess about those things.\nThe sooner your engineer knows your intentions, they can start figuring out how to apply their know-how on keeping that form secure to protect users from any attacks. They’ll start thinking about if they need to store that data in a session, or an ajax call is appropriate.\nI’m reminded of that joke about an engineer being sent out to get “some eggs” and never returning. No one’s really that obtuse, it’s just a fun reminder that you benefit from being more articulate about what you want to do. You need to know what kind of eggs, and if they’re cage-free, white, or brown. Otherwise you’re going to cause some roadblocks.\nEngineers: Come hang out with us. # Engineers have tons of knowledge to lend to a project. For example, one of my engineer friends and I were working on a iOS signup form. I’d planned and prototyped all the interactions, then he came in with a new library that let us do some neat animations to make the experience even better.\nThis kind of relationship challenges us to think deeper about our designs. Sitting alone pushing pixels with no regard to how it’s built doesn’t make for a great product, but collaborating with the person building it does.\nThe more you show your engineer, the better your product will be. Prototypes are extremely helpful, much more so than a static mockup. You run the risk of making too many assumptions if you’re looking at a picture of the thing rather than the thing itself. An engineer can help make your design even stronger. If you don’t code, find a way to demonstrate your intentions by looking at other products or do an animation in Flash or After Effects.\nGetting to warp speed. # It feels like all of this comes down to talking about and collaborating on your work. Don’t let each of you sit alone waiting for something to be thrown over. If you and your engineer collaborate like Spock and Kirk, you’ll build amazing things together faster than you’ve ever thought.\n"},{"id":45,"href":"/docs/published-00015/","title":"In which a nerd changes almost every part of his life to be better designer","section":"Guides \u0026 Published Articles","content":"Original post\n💡 I wrote this article in 2014, and my views have evolved since this. Focus is still important, but please do not change every part of your life to be a better designer. Instead, change it to be a more thoughtful and kind human. The design, or whatever you do, will naturally follow. A guide for designers young (and not so young) # As a young designer, I found myself unable to focus on my work. I had to attend to so many other distractions, and I feel like it made it tougher to improve my craft. It took a few years of examination what to remove or change, but I settled into a comfortable groove that helped me think a little deeper about the problems I have to solve.\nWhat follows is a short list of things that ended up working for me. Maybe they’ll help you, too.\nMy phone is on Do Not Disturb almost all day # It’s one of my favorite features of iOS. I’d been working on something close to it, but stopped after Apple released this. I keep have a list of VIPs that can call me if necessary, but it’s on from 9pm to 5:30pm. That means 3 1/2 hours of availability for calls every day—it’s lovely.\nDoing this lets me focus more on whatever I’m doing without worrying about someone calling to distract me. Besides, they’ll call back if it’s urgent.\nI don’t have a digital clock in my menu bar # I find I would constantly stare at the clock every day and think “oh, it’s only 3:30! Will 5 get here UGH!” In bring mindful about the clock, I would stress about it not moving quickly enough or that I’d only a small amount of time until some event.\nMaking it a small analog clock in my menu bar has made it tougher to read at a glance, and I find I’m able to think more deeply about what I’m doing because not really thinking as much about time as I used to. It’s probably my Designer OCD, but it’s been helpful.\nTurn off (most) push notifications # Getting into a flow is important, and nothing should interrupt me unless it’s important (or a GIF). I don’t let apps send me push notifications unless they meet specific criteria:\nWill it tell me if someone really needs me? Will it tell me if something important’s changing about my schedule? Will I get stuck out in some weird weather? If they don’t meet those criteria, then they can GTFO of my notification list. Why? I’m busy, don’t bother me.\nSingle task # Doing one thing at at time feels great. Sure, you can bounce between every app and site at once, but you can’t dig in deep and give everything the attention it deserves. Sit down, ignore your phone and other emails until you’re finished.\nI find that when I multi-tasked, things would get overlooked and messy. I’d end up fixing mistakes that were caused by my false sense of being productive, which threw wrenches in my plans.\nI try to dig in for about an hour, then go check in on whatever I want for a few minutes before repeating.\nMake a to-do list and (mostly) stick to it # I start with the 3 most important things for my day. I write them down before I start the day (usually the day before) and come out swinging when it’s time to start. I don’t usually check email immediately, unless I’m expecting something important. More on that in a moment.\nI use Things to manage my to-dos. It helps organize things into separate projects, I can attach due dates and filter them by priority. Been a user for years, don’t plan on dumping it any time soon, though holy cow I wish they’d update their UI for iOS 7.\nManage the shit out out of email # As someone who’s a maker, I really like the idea of checking email twice a day (or as infrequently as I can get away with). Not everyone has that luxury, but that’s ok with me. Here’s what I do:\nIf I can handle the email and its contents in a minute or less, do it right away. If I can’t do it immediately, star or flag it, then archive it to act on later. (Mailbox handles this for you in a glorious way) Use filters to automatically move notifications, etc. to their own folder. Use unroll.me to summarize all your email notifications. Remember those things you starred or flagged for later? If you don’t do Mailbox, schedule time at the end of the day to handle all of that. It’ll help you make your list for the next day, too.\nSchedule meetings at the beginning or end of the day # Paul Graham wrote a good essay called Maker’s Schedule, Manager’s Schedule. It’s good, you should read it. It essentially says folks who make things (designers, developers, etc.) benefit by having blocks of time to do so; it also says difficulties arise when they have to adapt to a randomly-placed meeting.\nWhen you’re operating on the maker’s schedule, meetings are a disaster. A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking it into two pieces each too small to do anything hard in. Plus you have to remember to go to the meeting. That’s no problem for someone on the manager’s schedule. There’s always something coming on the next hour; the only question is what. But when someone on the maker’s schedule has a meeting, they have to think about it.\nIf possible, schedule meetings in a way that gives you the most time to do what you’re really paid to do—make stuff. I try to have all of mine in the afternoon.\nEat better # I had my first studio job right out of college. My diet consisted a lot of fat, sugar/carbs, and salt. Sodas, white breads, all that. My head felt like a fog hung over it constantly, and deeper thinking was difficult. So was regulating my blood sugar. My mood was all over the map, too.\nI felt like this way of living hindered my work, not to mention I gained weight. After leaving the job, I moved across the country to sometimes-sunny (read: for 2 months of the year) Seattle and changed my diet shortly thereafter. I lost about 20 pounds by stopping refined sugars alone over the course of a few months. I felt so much better, plus I didn’t have to constantly deal with carb comas and spiking blood sugar. Big help for focus there.\nEase up on the caffeine # I stopped caffeine a few years ago. I found myself more stressed, anxious, and unfocused because I ended up having a couple cups a day. I’d drink some before diving into a project, but I felt too buzzy to do much deep thinking—I could crank through some lower-level tasks quickly though.\nDumping it gave me one hell of a headache for a weekend, but I came out of it and felt wonderful. My focus, productivity and overall attitude got much better.\nI still enjoy some nice decaf. It took searching through every brand to find the right one that had a decent flavor, but I ended up finding what I needed. I also switched to tea for my main drink, which has many other health benefits. I usually drink herbal teas, but will occasionally indulge a white tea (silver needle). One cup doesn’t seem to have a marked increase in any stress, and helps me feel both calm and alert.\nI’d never say you have to dump it entirely, but I thought that’d be better for me.\n(I intentionally buried this bit of heresy in the middle.)\nHit the gym # I didn’t start this until a few years after eating better. I avoided it it as much as I could. I hated the idea of (most) physical activity, especially avoided a place like a gym. Who would want to go into a place that stinks, everyone was nasty sweaty and who knows what kind of viruses lurked on those machines.\nAfter over a year at it, I can say it’s consistently been one of the biggest mood lifters. It’s enhanced my quality of life, and turned me onto things like hiking. I try to go 5 times a week for at least 30 minutes. I alternate weights and cardio. I’ve gained a little weight back, but it’s mostly muscle. Seriously, I feel terrific.\nI became interested in how working out/exercising could affect how my brain functioned, and a book called Spark spelled it out for me:\nA notable experiment in 2007 showed that cognitive flexibility improves after just a thirty-five minute treadmill session at either 60 percent or 70 percent of maximum heart rate.\nBasically, go get your heart rate up. You’ll be better equipped to deal with the problems of the day.\nFinishing up # I’ve gone though most aspects of my life to allow me the most time and focus to solve problems. It may not be what you need, but it was a tremendous help for me. I’m hopeful this will help make your life better as a designer, too.\n"},{"id":46,"href":"/docs/published-00011/","title":"How To Make An Effective Style Guide With Adobe Fireworks (Smashing Magazine)","section":"Guides \u0026 Published Articles","content":"Original post\nI started with style guides like any other obsessive-compulsive designer: with the desire to make it simple to maintain and grow a design. Plus, knowing which component to use in a given situation is nice, too, right? Since making this a regular practice, I’ve found it’s been like having a nice combination of a CSS class and a pattern library all in one.\nOne of the first questions, understandably, is why use Fireworks for a style guide? Well, for me, it’s mostly because of symbols and styles. Sure, you could use similar things in Photoshop, but I find Fireworks’ implementation to be smarter.\nHere’s why I love it:\nSymbols update everywhere, and you have to update them only once. Symbols have states, which let you easily show things such as selected and unselected states. Symbols may be placed on a single page for easy editing. If the styles are for the Web, you can easily export them as CSS. This article is all about understanding why you would want to set up a style guide using Fireworks, and you’ll also get a little starter template that I like to use.\nFurther Reading on SmashingMag: # Creating A Living Style Guide: A Case Study How To Design Style Guides For Brands And Websites Smashing Magazine’s Style Guide Automating Style Guide-Driven Development Important note: Fireworks’ future is uncertain, as Adobe decided to feature-freeze it in May 2013. There are rumors of Adobe working on a replacement, but nothing definite so far. I’ve spent the last few months with an alternative, Sketch, and found it to be… well, pretty fantastic! It’s a young Mac app but shows promise. Also, while Fireworks (CS6) is unlikely to receive any major updates in future, it is still distributed and supported by Adobe and should work on the latest Windows and Mac machines. You can read more about Fireworks’ future in this pretty detailed article.\nA Style Guide? # What is exactly a “style guide”, and why would you want to create one? Let’s start with a brief quote from a well-known encyclopedia:\n“A style guide or style manual is a set of standards for the writing and design of documents, either for general use or for a specific publication, organization or field. The implementation of a style guide provides uniformity in style and formatting within a document and across multiple documents.”\nThe biggest reason to create a style guide? The sheer amount of time you’ll save. Depending on the size of the project, reproducing your changes could take minutes or hours. Imagine designing a game, a complex website, a mobile app or a large corporate intranet: having to update one element that appears on dozens or hundreds of pages would be a tedious, madness-inducing task. You have better things to do, like look at cute cat pictures — why waste your time doing the same thing over and over again?\nA style guide helps you to maintain a consistent look over time, and Fireworks can save a lot of time.\nInstead of wondering how to style headings, you could look to the style guide for answers. As your design grows and you add elements, putting all of the elements on one page will help to ensure that they look like they were all crafted by the same hand — or at least look consistent. The secondary benefit is that you won’t have to solve the same design problem multiple times.\nIf you work on a team or for a client, handing off the document to someone else is very easy. You’ve already done the work of specifying how things should look; so, anyone else can step in and pick up where you left off.\nSpeaking of which, if you’ve ever applied a CSS class or ID to an HTML element, then you’ve basically written a style guide — even if you didn’t necessarily formalize it as such.\nWhen you’re presenting a design to a client or team, use the style guide to guide your presentation. A lot of people are talking about style tiles, style prototypes and element collages these days; there’s no reason why a style guide can’t fit in there. It’s a great way to help someone visualize what a product will look like without having to design every screen.\nWho Uses Style Guides Anyway? # The short answer is: a lot of people. Companies use them; banks generate reams and reams of documentation on how the logo should be implemented and which pixels should go where. While extending a brand across a wide range of products and services is complex, a small company typically does not need such extensive documentation yet still would benefit from consolidating its design standards into a single set of guidelines, a style guide.\nThe Basics # So what should be included in a style guide? Well, I usually put these few things in mine:\nheadings; text size of body copy; links (don’t forget visited links if you’re making a website!); sizes and treatment of images; logo; important modules, like headers and carousels. If you’re making an app, the list might be a little more extensive. I’d also include elements such as:\nbutton types and styles; navigation bar styles; table styles; icons. Fireworks is not the most suitable application for defining such things as animations, CSS transforms and transitions, or non-Web-font families (or CSS styles in general, although Fireworks does export CSS code, if needed). These are a critical part of the experience but might be better defined with a prototype or the like.\n(Some specifications of motion design are useful in a style guide — such as easing, timing, gradient, rotation, and scaling end points — but an interactive prototype would demonstrate these much better than a static image or document.)\nAll that being said, the size of the style guide should fit the project. If you’re making a simple app, you could probably keep it lean. If you’re working for a financial institution, then it might need to be substantially bigger and more prescriptive. The format and level of detail are up to you.\nIf you’re developing a mobile app, ensure that the design and development team is familiar with the human interface guidelines of the relevant device or platform. Apple, Google, Microsoft and others publish guidelines to ensure quality and consistency. The guidelines are geared to designers, but you might want to ensure that your team understands things like the minimum touch size for buttons (44 × 44 pixels for iOS, by the way) and the standards for typography and icons.\nI try to keep everything on one page in Fireworks, because exporting slices is much easier if all elements are on the same page (more on that later). The alternative is going to each page, exporting an image, checking that I’ve put it in the right folder, and then cursing myself if I’ve accidentally saved it to the wrong spot.\nSpeaking of which, aren’t slices in Fireworks awesome? Without them, we’d have to do something like this:\ncopy symbol to new document, paste symbol, trim canvas to fit, save symbol, close, repeat 50 times (getting sadder each time). Clearly, no one would want to do this. If slices were a person you could hang out with at a bar, I’d buy them drinks all night.\nUse symbols and styles as often as possible. With them, you can easily create something once and update it throughout the document. (By the way, Fireworks doesn’t always honor updates to styles inside of symbols. Sometimes you’ll have go into each symbol and refresh the style individually. It’s a bit of a drag, but it happens so rarely that I’m not bothered.)\nA Quick Primer On Symbols, Slices And Styles # Symbols # Use a symbol when a UI element repeats throughout the website or application. The usual candidates are buttons, icons, images and logos. A symbol has states, too, giving you the flexibility to display various states of an element (for example selected and unselected) or just to test various iterations of an item.\nSymbols are helpful and even have states! (View large version)\nTo convert an element to a symbol, simply select it and go to Modify → Symbol → Convert to Symbol… (or press F8).\nConvert an object to a symbol.\nIn the “Convert to Symbol” dialog, you can define the type of symbol (graphic, animation, button), whether to enable 9-slice guides, and whether to save the symbol to the common library:\nThe “Convert to Symbol” dialog. (View large version)\nStyles # I generally reserve styles for text (font family, size, color, drop-shadow live filters, etc.) and buttons (color, appearance, etc.).\nA style may define font size, color, font family, live filters and more. (View large version)\nFor example, if you add borders or live filters (for example, drop-shadows) to an image or button and want them to be easily reusable, make them styles. Also, symbols may contain elements with styles.\nSlices # Once your symbols are set, create a slice for each element. Fireworks’ naming convention is not human-friendly (it comes from old Web layout practice: [Document Name]*[Row Number]*[Column Number]). So, look to the all-powerful Properties panel to create your own names for slices.\nInsert a rectangular slice an an object. (View large version)\nUseful tip: You can highlight multiple elements and create individual slices for each one. Simply select all of the elements on the canvas, and go to Insert Rectangular Slice → Multiple slices! It’s a real time-saver.\nTo create multiple slices, select multiple objects on the canvas, select “Insert Rectangular Slice,” and then the “Multiple” option. (View large version)\nResolution-Independence # If you’re creating an app, try to work with vector graphics whenever possible, which make it much easier to scale icons infinitely to higher-resolution devices. I’ll have to gloss over some finer points, such as ensuring that icons scale down well.\nUseful tip: The Icon Design Handbook has you covered on that front. It has has great tips on making beautiful icons. Also, Ivo Mynttinen teaches quite a few things about designing icons with Fireworks.\nSo, how do we achieve this in Fireworks? Sure, we could drop in regular and @2x versions, but vectors can be exported as SVGs, courtesy of Aaron Beall’s handy Export extension.\nUseful tip: Another article on Smashing Magazine gets a little nerdy talking about “Resolution Independence With SVG.”\nUsually when designing for the Web, an icon font is most helpful. I have nothing but love for IcoMoon, which creates an icon font from SVG graphics that you upload, for free. Icon fonts currently have some limitations, such as individual elements being confined to one color. So, if you need multiple colors, gradients and so on for your icons, then exporting an SVG or a @2x PNG might be best. (Note: SVG is supported in Internet Explorer 8+ and in recent versions of all other major browsers.)\nWhen To Start Preparing the Guide? # Picking the right time to build a style guide isn’t an exact science. I usually start once I’ve determined a direction for the project. Creating it first usually wouldn’t make sense because I’ll often experiment with fairly different ideas. Doing twice the work doesn’t appeal to me.\nYou also don’t want to end up a slave to the process early on. Creativity should be messy, weird and fun — bottling all that up in a style guide too early on would really break your groove and stifle the design. The style guide should reinforce your creativity and, therefore, should come second. Don’t wait till the end either, because you want it to guide the rest of the process.\nIn short, don’t do it too early, but don’t wait until you’ve finished the design. Having to duplicate objects from page to page is a good sign that you should create an asset (i.e. with symbols) or define a style (i.e. with styles). My style guides usually start out as a working canvas: Design elements and type treatments that I like will hang out on the canvas until I decide they should be standardized (and become part of the style guide) or discarded.\nUsing symbols and styles early on also means that you won’t have to apply endless updates if one icon changes. I’ve overlooked doing this a few times and probably said some words that I regretted as I went back to adjust each little mistake afterwards.\nGetting Started With Your Style Guide # Before creating the canvas, keep in mind that it is a living document, so you’ll need to help it grow, pruning here and adding there.\n“How Do I Set One Up?” # The short answer is, whatever works for you. I’ll share what works for me, and you can build on it. Or throw it away. It’s fine, really. Your mileage will vary according to what you’re creating.\nI’ll open a page at the beginning of the document. Once I’ve gotten a sense of the direction of the design, I’ll put some of its elements on this page and make styles and symbols out of them.\nThen, I’ll lay out a few common elements. If we were making an iPhone app, they would be the following:\ncolors; typography; icons; interface elements. A Starter Style Guide # Good friends help by telling; best friends help by sharing. Because we’re basically besties at this point, I’ll share a style guide that I made for a simple app. Inside, you’ll find the following:\nelements page, with icons, images and font examples; home screen; detail screen for articles. Teehan + Lax has made its own UI PSD for iOS 7 that is perfect for getting an app style guide going. Even though the file is not in a native format of Fireworks, it can be easily opened in Fireworks; all of the elements are vectors and so are perfectly editable. (Fireworks can read PSDs pretty well in general, with just a few minor limitations.)\nOK! We’ve got our interface elements. Now, create a document that is 2000 × 2000 pixels.\nCreate a new 2000 × 2000-pixel canvas for our style guide. (View large version)\nYou might not want to give the style guide the shape of an app or website, or else a client or team member might think that they’re viewing an actual app.\nDrag in some interface elements and start experimenting! Depending on the scope of the app, you’ll be dragging in various elements. Here are a few that appear in almost every app I make:\nstatus bar, menu bar, action icons. Once you’ve determined a direction, there’s no reason why you can’t begin to customize this style guide to match the feel of your app. It’s a nice way to ensure that everything you’re designing works holistically. Plus, your client will appreciate the details.\nI’ll also start to use the guide for some production duties, like saving assets. When designing for iOS, ensure that the normal versions of icons look as crisp as the @2x versions. I’m a big fan of “Snap to Pixel” when working with icons (go to Modify → Snap to Pixel or type Control/Command + K) — it helps with keeping things looking sharp at small sizes. I fully admit that this is a case of designer’s OCD, and I’m OK with that. I’ll create the normal-sized versions later in the process, when I’m ready to send over some assets to the developer. No sense in creating extra work for myself early on.\nAlso, I design at the @2x resolution by default because I find that scaling down for smaller resolutions is easier than scaling up. Remember, though, that your font sizes and other elements will be double their normal size when you do this. When working with text, specify in the style guide the intended type size, not what Fireworks says. (When scaling text along with the document’s overall size, Fireworks will change its size, but the Properties panel might not report the actual new size. It seems to be an odd limitation of Fireworks’ text engine).\nYour Style Guide and Production-Ready Assets # Here’s where it gets more fun. Now that your buttons, logos and other elements are in the style guide, you can easily highlight them and creates slices. If you’re working on a project that requires higher-resolution assets, then duplicating your symbols on the style guide’s canvas and exporting them directly from that page is simple.\nSelect all of the elements to be sliced, and then go to Edit → Insert → Rectangular Slice. (Remember what I said earlier about human-unfriendly slice names?)\nCreate rectangular slices.

You can even give slices their own export settings (PNG32, PNG24, PNG8, GIF or any custom format — for example, PNG8 with a limited number of colors, JPEG Progressive with a set quality, etc.). The settings will be saved in the Fireworks PNG file, so exporting and re-exporting assets is very easy.\nEach slice may have its own export settings, which are remembered by Fireworks.

The Pages, Layers and States panels help you to navigate quickly through the Fw PNG file. I use states to prototype designs for a particular view or page, and each view or page will have its own page in the document. I’ll generally make a master page (containing the chrome and unchanging elements in the design, such as the menu or tab bar) so that I have one less thing to paste in the page.\nStyles are helpful because you can select an element and immediately apply a style to it.\nThe document library holds all of the symbols, and it’s an easy reference point if you need to drag something onto the canvas. I find myself just copying symbols from an existing page. (Quick aside: Fireworks has some issues with trackpad scrolling in panels, but you Windows geeks should be just fine with scrolling, I hear).\nFinally, the Properties panel gives you complete control of the properties of all types of objects, including vector objects, bitmaps, symbols, auto shapes, vector masks, slices and more.\nClosing Thoughts # Useful tip: Another article on Smashing Magazine gets a little nerdy talking about “Resolution Independence With SVG.”\nUsually when designing for the Web, an icon font is most helpful.

The Pages, Layers and States panels help you to navigate quickly through the Fw PNG file. I use states to prototype designs for a particular view or page, and each view or page will have its own page in the document. I’ll generally make a master page (containing the chrome and unchanging elements in the design, such as the menu or tab bar) so that I have one less thing to paste in the page.\nStyles are helpful because you can select an element and immediately apply a style to it.\nThe document library holds all of the symbols, and it’s an easy reference point if you need to drag something onto the canvas. I find myself just copying symbols from an existing page. (Quick aside: Fireworks has some issues with trackpad scrolling in panels, but you Windows geeks should be just fine with scrolling, I hear).\nFinally, the Properties panel gives you complete control of the properties of all types of objects, including vector objects, bitmaps, symbols, auto shapes, vector masks, slices and more.\nClosing Thoughts # Style guides, in their various shapes and sizes, are a critical part of any project, and using one brings many benefits, including the following:\nkeeps the project visually and functionally consistent as it grows; keeps you from having to repeat the same task over and over; helps the developer understand how to build what you have designed, so they’ll ask you fewer questions; makes it easier to grow or modify the website or application. In short, if you’d like a consistent, healthy app, then don’t overlook style guides. A guide converts design styles into values and standards of coding, and it could be invaluable to your project.\nIf you use Adobe Fireworks in your daily design workflow and have any questions about how to build a style guide, let me know on Twitter or here in the comments — I’d be more than happy to help! I’d also be glad to hear of your own experience with making (and updating) style guides.\nFurther Reading # If you’d like to dig a little deeper into style guides and other neat things that you can do with Fireworks, here is some reading:\n“Creating a Pattern Library With Evernote and Fireworks,” Kris Niles, Smashing Magazine “Useful Fireworks Techniques and Features for Large Design Teams,” Kris Niles, Smashing Magazine “Developing a Design Workflow in Adobe Fireworks,” Joshua Bullock, Smashing Magazine “UI Style Guide Template (PSD),” Tony Thomas, MediaLoot “Style Guide,” Wikipedia “Icon Design Handbook,” Jon Hicks “Design Cutting-Edge iOS Apps With Adobe Fireworks,” Ivo Mynttinen, Smashing Magazine “The Present and Future of Adobe Fireworks,” Michel Bozgounov, Smashing Magazine "},{"id":47,"href":"/docs/published-00016/","title":"iOS Grid System, A Free Extension For Adobe Fireworks (Smashing Magazine)","section":"Guides \u0026 Published Articles","content":"Original post\nAbout The Author # Joshua Mauldin is a design leader and visual artist who got his start creating websites for bands.

Trusted by 200,000+ folks.\nI’ll come right out and say it. I think the grid is the unsung hero of a good design. It gives structure and lets the design fall perfectly into place on the canvas. With a grid, adapting and building something new into your design is easy. Think of it like a house’s foundation. With a solid foundation, the house is stable, and building on it is easy. With a solid grid, your design can easily be adapted to accommodate whatever changes come along.\nToday, we’ll share iOS Grid System, which I’ve been using when designing apps in Adobe Fireworks. The extension is free for both personal and commercial use, and it works with all iOS devices as of the beginning May 2013.\nInstalling and using the iOS grid extension in Fireworks is pretty easy. We’ll explain the process in detail, but you can jump to the download section and try the extension right away.\nWhy Are Grids Useful? # Before we continue, a bit about grids.\nI like consistency. It helps me feel like I can trust whatever I’m using at the moment. At a deeper level, users appreciate consistency because it builds trust — trust that you aren’t going to pull the rug out from under them in the middle of whatever they’re doing. They know what they’re going to get, and they’ll be more comfortable with you if everything lines up just right, rather than if elements look like spaghetti thrown against a wall. In the end, consistency improves trust and credibility through better design quality, and it improves usability by making a website or application more understandable, predictable and findable.\nAs a designer, I like figuring out a system that makes updating easy for me. Grids help here because I don’t always have to worry about how a particular element should align with another; I’ve thought ahead and done that work already.\nLearning about grids helps you put out better designs. Grids — specifically, how to apply them so that a design can be consistent and grow into itself — are an essential topic for designers.\nActually, they’re only essential if you want an interface that is:\nconsistent, easy to update, polished even after you’ve finished working on the interface. (I guess we needed to make that clear first.) Whether you work with clients or are on an internal team, grids are especially useful when those last-minute “Hey, can you just add this little button in somewhere? It’ll take only a second, I swear!” changes come in. Accommodating that request becomes much less trouble simply because a good grid is in place. Just pick the appropriate column (or columns), and boom — you’re done. Happy client, happy you!\nI like what Khoi Vinh has to say about grids in this short (but great) interview:\n“Khoi Vinh: On the Grid,” from The Color Machine\n\u0026ldquo;The grid is a tool for me to impose order and logic and law. There’s a framework. If you remove all subjectivity, then you get some essential truth, some core idea that’s not clouded by inaccuracies or approximations or subjective feelings.\u0026rdquo;\nWhy Make An iOS Grid Extension For Adobe Fireworks? # The easy answer is that most of my designs these days are for iOS, and a grid system is essential to every design I craft. I start using it early on in the design process, and having a solid grid in place when I design makes sense for me.\nI decided to build it after noticing how much time I spent making decisions that I could have easily automated. With this extension, I don’t have to spend time tediously clicking and dragging around to make sure my grid’s shapes and guides are pixel-perfect. This extension allows me spend more time on other important parts of the process (such as how the design works and looks).\nNow, I just open Adobe Fireworks, create a new project, and then select what iOS device I’ll be designing for and the number of columns I’ll need. Then, the grid appears on my canvas, along with some nicely sized gutters, which help my design breathe a little easier.\nHere’s what it looks like (notice the green overlay):\nThe iOS grid in practice. (Large version)\nAbout The iOS Grid Extension # The extension is made for Adobe Fireworks and is optimized to help you create designs for all of Apple’s mobile devices (in both portrait and landscape modes) as of May 2013. It will be updated as new iOS devices and resolutions arrive.\niOS%20Grid%20System,%20A%20Free%20Extension%20For%20Adobe%20Firewo%202be8a23aacb845589de3f3ee8a63045e/grid-full.thumbnail\niOS Grid System will build your grid automatically on any page in Adobe Fireworks. (Large version)\nHere’s what’s included in the extension package:\nNon-Retina iPhone (3GS) grid command Grid size: 320 × 480 pixels Retina iPhone (4, 4S) grid command Grid size: 640 × 960 pixels Retina iPhone (5) grid command Grid size: 640 × 1136 pixels Non-Retina iPad (1, 2, Mini (2012)) grid command Grid size: 1024 × 768 pixels Retina iPad (3, 4) grid command Grid size: 2048 × 1536 pixels Note: Apple doesn’t allow designers to specifically target the screen of the iPad Mini. To work on a design for iPad Mini, you can simply use the non-Retina iPad resolution, which is 1024 × 768 pixels.\nYou’ll notice that all of these grids have a few things in common:\nBoth the landscape and portrait versions of the grid for each device share the same column and gutter widths. On each side of the grid is a mini-column that helps your layout align with the leftmost and rightmost icons in the status bar. What good is a grid if everything doesn’t align properly, right? For the iPhone, each column is 30 pixels wide, with a 10-pixel gutter (the Retina iPhone is 60 and 20 pixels, respectively). The iPad versions use 44-pixel-wide columns with a 20-pixel gutter (the Retina iPad is 88 and 40 pixels, respectively).\nThese exact dimensions make it easy for you to have adequate space between each column, while giving you flexibility in structuring the design. This is the best combination I’ve found from experimenting with different column and gutter sizes, because I’m able to keep the same dimensions while adding or subtracting columns as I change device orientations.\nHow iOS Grid System Works # When a command from iOS Grid System is run, it automatically creates two things: “guides” and “shapes.”\nHere’s how to access the iOS Grid System commands from the “Commands” menu.\n1. Guides # A set of guides will be placed directly on the page.\nYou can lock them (in the menu, View → Guides → Lock Guides); you can activate snap-to-guides (View → Guides → Snap to Guides), which can make moving and resizing objects on the page easier; and you can temporarily hide or show the guides (View → Guides → Show Guides).\n2. Grid Layer # The shapes (which will serve as columns) will be placed on their own locked layer in the page, named “Grid,” and combined into one symbol. Because the shapes are added as a symbol, reusing them anywhere else in the document is easy, if that’s your thing.\nAfter you run a command from iOS Grid System, in the Layers panel you’ll notice that a new layer with the grid on it (contained within a single symbol) has been added. The “Grid” layer is initially locked, to prevent you from accidentally making changes to it.\nThe columns in the “Grid” layer have 33% transparency, and objects in your design placed on layers underneath it will be visible. But you can move the “Grid” layer to the bottom of the stack, if you prefer.\nAnd when you don’t need the “Grid” layer to be visible, simply toggle its visibility in the Layers panel.\nFurther Notes # Can The Commands Be Run On Pages With Existing Content? # Yes, absolutely!\nWhen the extension is used on a page with existing content, it will create a new “Grid” layer, move it to the top of the layers stack, lock it automatically, and then return focus to the original layer on which you were working. Smart!\nIt will also resize the canvas automatically (read more about that in the next section).\nSize Of Canvas And Cropping Of Objects # Here’s another thing to keep in mind. When running a command from the set on a page that already has some objects placed on the canvas, and if the canvas is larger than the iOS device you are designing for, then some of the objects may be cropped or deleted when the canvas is made smaller. This won’t happen in all cases, though, because in Fireworks there’s a setting (in Edit → Preferences → Edit) that controls the behavior of canvas cropping:\nIf “Delete objects when cropping” is checked, then the objects will be cropped with the canvas. If “Delete objects when cropping” is unchecked, then all objects will be preserved when cropping the canvas. The “Delete objects when cropping” preference can be toggled on and off by going to Edit → Preferences → Edit.\nWhen you run the command on a page with some existing artwork on it, this preference is important to remember!\nRunning The Commands Multiple Times # You can use any of these commands multiple times in one document. Just create a new page and select the command you wish to run, and a new set of guides and grids will be created.\n(Just be careful when you try to run them multiple times on the same page. This is not recommended — things can get weird.)\nDownload, Install And Use iOS Grid System # Want to try iOS Grid System for yourself? Follow these simple steps:\nDownload the iOS Grid System extension (the ZIP contains an MXP file and is around 20 KB). Alternatively, you can download it from its GitHub page, because this project is also maintained there, if you’re that kind of geek. Unzip and then run the MXP file, and it’ll launch Adobe Extension Manager. Follow the on-screen instructions, and you’ll be ready to use it in Fireworks! (For general information on installing and working with extensions in Fireworks, I highly recommend the article “Optimizing the Design Workflow With Extensions”.) Open Fireworks and create a new document. As mentioned, the size of the canvas doesn’t matter, because the command will resize the canvas automatically. Go to Commands → iOS Grid System and select an iOS device. Then, iOS Grid System will go to work building your grid! Alternatively, you can apply the extension to existing pages as well. But keep in mind that, while existing artwork won’t be touched, the canvas will be resized (unless, of course, you run a command that matches the dimensions of the current page).\nRoadmap And Final Thoughts # You’ve probably already figured out that I love grids and find them very useful. If you use Adobe Fireworks for iOS design, I hope that this grid system will help your design grow as you maintain it.\nI’m also curious to see how and where you use it. Share a link to your app or mobile website. We’d love to see it in action!\nNow let’s open it up to your suggestions for improvements. This idea has existed (mostly) in a vacuum up until now, and these kinds of things always benefit from other people’s suggestions. For example, I’m curious if anyone would prefer to use templates, instead of commands that run on a per-page basis. Or perhaps you’ve found a bug somewhere.\nI would greatly appreciate all kinds of feedback!\nOf course, any questions about how to use this extension are welcome, too. Just leave a comment — I’d be happy to help.\nOther Resources # “Interview With Khoi Vinh,” The Grid System “Grid,” Thinking With Type, Ellen Lupton We didn’t talk about typography here, but this is great resource to learn more about the fundamentals of good typography, too! “Design Cutting-Edge iOS Apps With Adobe Fireworks,” Ivo Mynttinen, Smashing Magazine “Optimizing the Design Workflow With Extensions,” Ashish Bogawat, Smashing Magazine “Creating a Pattern Library With Evernote and Fireworks,” Kris Niles, Smashing Magazine Establishing Your Grid In Photoshop The Semantic Grid System: Page Layout For Tomorrow Design Cutting Edge iOS Apps With Adobe Fireworks Further Reading # "},{"id":48,"href":"/docs/published-00017/","title":"My real problem with in-app rating modules","section":"Guides \u0026 Published Articles","content":"Original post\n“Like this app? Give us 5 stars! UGH STOP PLZ.” # The conversation where folks are growing collectively tired of being asked to rate apps has been interesting to watch.\nSome tech folks want to encourage users to rate an app 1 star because they asked for a rating. I think that’s unfair, because that doesn’t seem like a real review at all to me. It doesn’t tell me that the app is buggy, that it steals my data, or doesn’t alert me to a tornado. It just tells me someone was bothered by being asked to rate an app.\nTo be clear, I think just asking for ratings isn’t the right thing, but I don’t think asking for them is wrong in and of itself. What I think is missing is this: asking for negative feedback.\nMy biggest problem with App Store reviews are this: they’re a one-way conversation. There should be something better, more conversational. I think that’s where feedback modules can be improved over the standard.\nFeedback modules, not ‘Rate this App’ modules # I believe a solid way to approach asking for feedback and ratings is to ask for feedback, both good and bad. If it’s positive, send them to the App Store to write a review, because you likely don’t have much to talk about. If the feedback’s negative, open a dialog.\nThe App Store (for better or worse) doesn’t yet offer a way to interact with a customer. I can’t think of many people that’d leave their contact information on a public spot like that, myself included. I believe we should open an email and have a conversation with that person. That lets the developer find out what the problem is, and gives them an opportunity to solve it with the person experiencing it.\nWhat I did to solve the problem # I implemented this pattern in a medium-sized news app with thousands of users, and read every single email that came in (there were a lot). Here’s how it worked:\nAfter 3 days from launch, each person saw a dialog box asking how their experience was Positive feedback asked people to leave a review Negative feedback asked people to contact us After telling us how you felt, you could dismiss this without emailing or rating us We later amended this to let people dismiss this instead of prompting a positive or negative response, and let folks see this after an accumulated usage time. We found some users would launch the app (say on a Friday afternoon), quit it, and return a few days later (like Monday morning), which made it harder to get a good idea of how the app was.\nEach person got a reply from the support team attempting to help with their problem. Some were angry, most confused because they lost a password, and some experienced legitimate problems that we couldn’t find on our own. Ultimately, these emails were directly responsible for improving the product, and ultimately turned its health around.\nPS: if you go all Darth Vader here, you’re basically doing some real shady work and deserve all the karmic flack you catch for that. Death Star icon designed by\nDarth Vader, or why feedback modules aren’t the problem # The first thing I hear when talking about app ratings and this approach is that some would call it a dark pattern. I don’t think of it that way—it’s a tool, just like The Force.\nOne could argue that this fits the definition of a dark pattern, since it directs positive feedback one way and negative another, but it doesn’t feel that way to me: it’s more about how it’s used.\nSure, it could be used for evil and silence all dissent. Just don a black outfit with a sweet cape, build a Death Star and Force Choke all those reviews to death by sending them to a never-checked inbox (see above image with caption). Or you can use it for good to get meaningful feedback from real users and help them with their problem to make your product better.\nIt’s been my experience that if folks are motivated to complain, they will do it to you, the App Store, and anyone else who will listen, regardless of what types of barriers you introduce for deterring that kind of feedback. More so if your app is a real stinker. If your customers have a problem, you’re doing them a service by being there to talk to them.\nWhy not just have a support link?\nI prefer to have a proactive approach when it comes to feedback. I look at feedback modules as someone checking in on you to make sure things meet your expectations. If they don’t, let’s figure out what we can do to make it better. I’d rather it be me asking how things are going rather than someone coming to find me and tell me about a problem.\nI’m ok, you’re ok. # In closing, I don’t think app feedback modules aren’t bad. I’d just encourage developers to not be shady and try to inflate ratings. Talk to your customers, and it’ll help make this whole thing better.\n"},{"id":49,"href":"/docs/published-00010/","title":"How smartphones could improve texting emergency services","section":"Guides \u0026 Published Articles","content":"Original post\nAs of May 24, 2014, the main 4 carriers in the US will allow texting with 911. That’s great, but I wondered what it would look like if smartphones could build on top of that idea.\nI want design to do good and feel like a moment of crisis is an ideal spot to employ thoughtful design to ease a difficult situation. Plus, it’s fun to weave different technologies together. What follows are some initial thoughts and a prototype. I’d love to hear feedback on both.\nOverview and Goals # I wanted to allow users to have an efficient way of engaging with emergency services when certain situations arise. Composing a text message could be time-consuming in a moment where every second counts; good design can make this easier.\nIt’s also worth considering various use cases. Someone may not be able (or in a place to) speak—the operating system should assist them in the best way possible. Think about a person who may have a physical impairment or may be in a situation where speaking could further endanger them.\nSmartphones possess the ability to access user data, such as GPS-assisted location and contact information. Employing them along with the main types of emergency calls (fire, medical/accidents, crime) could speed the experience along greatly.\nA portion of the device’s battery could be reserved for emergency use. During an emergency, this could suspend other applications or non-critical systems to maximize battery life.\nThis experience should fit within the standard experience and not create a new visual language or groundbreaking new user interface. It is worth noting that this experience would exist on multiple platforms (Android, Windows Phone, and Blackberry). Given the tools available (Flinto and Sketch!), it was easier to make it happen on iOS.\nA person should be able to interact with emergency services in every way the operating system can create a text. This includes on the Lock Screen, the Messages app, and Siri. You’ll find more on that below.\nIt could also take advantage of the microphone during a text session if a user desires. They could initiate a one-way call without going into a call screen. This would be possible by working with a service like Twilio to send and store this data. Collecting it could also be beneficial in a domestic violence situation. (Thanks to Ben Vandgrift for that idea.)\nIf a phone’s been connected to a vehicle’s collision sensors via Bluetooth, it could detect a crash and send a notice to emergency services in the event of an accident.\nIn the event that a message couldn’t be delivered, this application would continuously attempt delivery, rather than fail and ask the user to send it again.\nPrototyped options for sending emergency service messages # Interaction via the Lock Screen. Play with the prototype on Flinto.\n1) Lock Screen # A user will tap the Emergency option on the Lock Screen, bringing up the dial pad, where the user now has the option to select Text. If a user selects Text, they can select their type of emergency, which reduces the time it takes to compose a text. They may select from any and all of the options presented, including not selecting any at all. (This is one situation where we may not want to force a choice.)\nMost types of 911 calls fall into the categories of needing firefighters, medics, police, and sometimes all 3. I’ve accounted for this in this experience.\nThe user’s information will be pre-filled in a text message, and it will include their name, phone number, and GPS-assisted current location. The user is sent to a customized SMS screen.\nUpdate: It’s important that we protect a person’s privacy. In light of that, texting through the lock screen keeps all other message threads hidden. (Thanks to @sulgi for the reminder)\n2) Messages # A user initiates a text to emergency services (in the US, it’s 911). The interface adapts slightly to highlight calling 911 and adds a toolbar to include various information such as the user’s GPS-assisted current location and contact information.\n3) Siri # When a user engages Siri, perhaps by saying “Tell 911 that there’s been an accident here,” Siri will create the text, pre-fill it with the user’s name, phone number, and GPS-assisted current location. Then the user is sent to a customized SMS screen, the same as in Option 1.\nClosing thoughts # I did this as an exercise to see how good design could make a tough situation easier and more efficient. Even if this goes nowhere (I hope it doesn’t!), it feels important for designers to consider applying their knowledge to other areas.\nI’d appreciate feedback on how to improve this concept. It would be wonderful to see a smartphone experience implemented—I’d love to know how, or if, that could happen.\nFurther Reading \u0026amp; Data # http://www.911.gov/pdf/Current911DataCollection-072613.pdf\nhttp://www.911.gov/whencall.html\nhttp://www.fcc.gov/guides/text-911-quick-facts-faqs\n"},{"id":50,"href":"/docs/example/table-of-contents/","title":"Table of Contents","section":"Example Site","content":" Ubi loqui # Mentem genus facietque salire tempus bracchia # Lorem markdownum partu paterno Achillem.

That means being principle-driven and not process-driven. Here’s why: each project, problem, and team are unique. Each person’s insight and experience are, too. Following principles instead of a rigorous process lets us honor that uniqueness to deliver truly wonderful results. Not only that, we can move quickly and with intention to deliver great software. You can read how it looks in practice, too.\n1. Design is careful # Design is like woodworking. To get the best from a piece of wood, you need to understand its properties: its knots, grain direction, and how far it will bend before it breaks. It will tell you what it wants to be If you listen. Consider the edge cases and unintended harm a product may create when making it, lest it end up in a dystopian Black Mirror episode. The richest insights come from spending quality time with the problem, isolated from distractions. Prize and prioritize deep, focused work time. 2. Design happens in short, repeatable cycles # Set strong, smart defaults but do not be beholden to any framework. Adapt the process to fit the need. Do not spend unnecessary time on preparation, ave a ruthless bias toward action and start strong. Prioritize delivering small bits of information quickly rather than one big thing slowly. It’s more valuable to have something working than something perfect. 3. Design is mindful # Maintain a beginner\u0026rsquo;s mind and actively suspend assumptions. In this way, it is possible to be fully present and unbiased when trying to understand a problem. Value gentleness and intuition over rigor and process. Stay objective…mostly. Data and goals are important, but are incomplete without intuition. Practice compassionate detachment, which allows one to advocate for what\u0026rsquo;s right and then let the client make the final call. 4. Design represents the users # Designers are the voice of the users and help our stakeholders map their needs to users’ expectations. Validate ideas constantly with users and the business. Designers owe clients more than their labor—they also owe clients their counsel. Do not shy away from hard conversations on the implications of a decision. 5. Design is collaborative # Strongly prefer tools that encourage collaboration (Figma, Miro, etc.). Work as a team with other disciplines, Design does not rule everything. Pair up with each other, even (and especially) across disciplines. Feedback is a gift. Welcome criticism and differing viewpoints. "},{"id":76,"href":"/design-process/","title":"My Design Process","section":"Joshua Mauldin, Designer and Author","content":"\u0026ldquo;Wait a minute,\u0026rdquo; you say to yourself, \u0026ldquo;Why do you, a design leader, need to spell out a design process? Doesn\u0026rsquo;t your team do that work?\u0026rdquo; Sure, the team might do it, but it\u0026rsquo;s important to spell out out for two reasons:\nI wouldn\u0026rsquo;t ask my team to do anything I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t do myself. And depending on the situation, I may actually do it myself. Practice, after all, is how you stay sharp and relevant. I want my team and other collaborators to know where I stand and where I\u0026rsquo;m coming from. That being said, my design process is thoughtful, intentional, and geared towards speedy delivery. From the first moment of every project, I collaborate deeply with everyone involved in its development.\nThis process isn’t always linear, nor is a double diamond or any other cute little infographic that makes for a good slide in a deck. It’s a set of strong defaults aimed at quickly discovering and delivering the best possible solution. (By the way, I wrote about the philosophy behind my process if you’d like to read it.)\nStrategy # Before beginning anything, I\u0026rsquo;ll try to understand the following:\nScope the engagement or effort: How long this will take? Who will it take? Who\u0026rsquo;s best for this project? And finally, what’s the value that everyone gets from this? Discover the problem: Instead of wasting time and money with unnecessary discovery exercises, I make sure I’m not going to tell a stakeholder something they already know. Find out who we’re helping: Good design starts with humans first. It’s imperative to sit with people (stakeholders, too!) listen, and understand what their problems are before jumping to a solution. Identify a product/market fit: Whether that’s an opportunity solution tree or another brainstorming exercise, I make sure that we can map a person’s needs to a company’s capabilities. Form hypotheses: I love a good test, and try to find ways to (in)validate notions quickly so we don\u0026rsquo;t waste time, money, or trust. Design # I do all the typical things you’d expect from a designer and have a relentless bias towards starting strong and delivering quickly.\nCenter on humans first: To to this, I create user research plans, write interview scripts, do ethnographic interviews to understand who I’m helping. I seek out diverse opinions from people who don’t look or think like me. This isn’t a one-and-done exercise, it’s a constant practice. Think in systems: Everything is connected. I consider the entire experience a person has when using what we make, not just the app I’m working on. Build consistently: Everything should feel like it’s in the same family. Remember: the design systems can change: they exists to serve us, not the other way around. Create prototypes: I craft prototypes at just the right fidelity to communicate the idea I need validation on. (Okay, so maybe I put a little more polish on it than most, but still: I get them out quickly.) Collaborate: Good products die in silos, as do designers. So anyone’s welcome in my Figma. I pair consistently with engineers, product managers, and anyone else involved to cultivate a shared sense of ownership and get the most of everyone’s insights. Managing and Mentoring # I take joy is in supporting a team and being a part of someone’s growth. Here’s what I practice as a leader:\nListen: It’s easy to jump to solutions, but your team likely already knows the answers. I help my team process their thoughts and draw out those solutions. Practice transparency: I can’t promise I’ll always do what my team wants, but I do promise to be transparent with the reasons behind any decision. Be consistent: I create consistent leveling guidelines and give everyone the chance to move up in a way that benefits both them and the company. Be with them: Leaders lose relevance when they don’t practice their craft. Pair with your team, learn and grow with them. Make it safe: I make it safe to give and receive feedback. Teams model their behavior of their leaders, especially when it comes to feedback and psychological safety. If leaders don’t make it safe to give feedback, everyone suffers.
