And this experiment is around creating my own cloud that I own. I’ve used iCloud for years and years, and I wanted to see if I could have a go at it on my own.\nThis is inspired by Derek Sivers’ Tech Independence post. I got my start there, but realized I wasn’t comfortable with OpenBSD in the same way I was Ubuntu, and I wanted to do a few other things, so I modified those directions.\nBefore You Begin # A few tips for you:\nIt’s worth it to set this up and let it run for a few weeks before totally leaving your old cloud platform. You don’t want to risk data loss. You should definitely back up your files. If you’re new to working in the command line, the app you use is called Terminal if you’re on macOS. Any time you see ~, it’s a shortcut to your user folder. On Mac/Linux, ~ replaces /Users/YourName/. On Ubuntu servers, it’s less relevant because you’re managing Nextcloud as root. But if you switch users (joshuagraves), ~ refers to /home/joshuagraves/. Generate an SSH Key Before Deploying the Server # To securely connect to your server without passwords, generate an SSH key before creating your server.\nGenerate an SSH key on your machine:\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \u0026#34;your-email@example.com\u0026#34; Save it when prompted (default: ~/.ssh/id_ed25519). No passphrase is required (optional for added security). Add the SSH Key to Vultr Before Deploying the Server:\nGo to Vultr Dashboard → Account → SSH Keys. Click Add SSH Key. Copy and paste the contents of ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub. Deploy a Vultr Server \u0026amp; Attach Block Storage # Now, you\u0026rsquo;ll create a new server.\nGo to Vultr → Deploy a New Instance. Choose: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS One-Click Nextcloud (DO NOT use Snap—Snap limits control over Nextcloud, like thumbnail generation). Shared CPU Plan (best price-performance balance). Enable backups (Vultr charges extra, but it’s worth it—you will screw up at some point). Attach your SSH key (so you can log in without a password). Once deployed, note: Public IP Address Initial Nextcloud Admin Username \u0026amp; Password (from Vultr panel) Root SSH Access (via SSH key) Create and Attach Block Storage # The default storage on Vultr instances is small. If you want to store photos, music, or large files, you need block storage.\nGo to Vultr → Block Storage → Add Volume. Choose: SSD (not NVMe) (NVMe is more expensive and usually unnecessary). Go bigger than you think you need (you CANNOT downsize block storage later). Attach it to the Nextcloud server you just created. Enable backups for block storage (extra cost but crucial for safety). Access Your Server via SSH # Use SSH to access your server securely:\nssh root@\u0026lt;SERVER_IP\u0026gt; This connects you using the SSH key you added earlier.\nTo mount block storage, you need to attach the block storage so Nextcloud uses it for data.\nFind your block storage by running:\nlsblk Look for your disk (mine was 500GB, so it appeared as):\nvdb 252:16 0 500G 0 disk └─vdb1 252:17 0 500G 0 part Now, you\u0026rsquo;ll format the block storage, but ONLY if it’s new.\nWARNING: This will wipe all data! Skip if it contains files. Unless you changed something, vdb1 is your volume name. Run:\nsudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdb1 Now you\u0026rsquo;ll mount your block storage:\nsudo mkdir -p /mnt/blockstorage sudo mount /dev/vdb1 /mnt/blockstorage You\u0026rsquo;ll want to make the system load this when it boots up so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to attach it each time. Run:\nsudo nano /etc/fstab In the file, add the following line:\nUUID=$(blkid -s UUID -o value /dev/vdb1) /mnt/blockstorage ext4 defaults,nofail 0 0 Press CTRL + X to save and apply it. Then run:\nsudo mount -a Configure Nextcloud to Use Block Storage for Data # Now we’ll point Nextcloud to use this directory. Run:\nsudo mv /var/www/html/data /mnt/blockstorage/nextcloud-data You\u0026rsquo;ll create what\u0026rsquo;s called a symlink (sometimes known as symbolic link or alias) to the new data directory by running:\nsudo ln -s /mnt/blockstorage/nextcloud-data /var/www/html/data Now that you\u0026rsquo;ve linked it, you want to add it to Nextcloud\u0026rsquo;s config file. Run:\nsudo nano /var/www/html/config/config.php In the file, look for datadirectory. Change it to your storage location:\n\u0026#39;datadirectory\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;/mnt/blockstorage/nextcloud-data\u0026#39;, Now that Nextcloud can see block storage, it needs write access. Run this, which grants it and any new files the proper permission.\nsudo chown -R www-data:www-data /mnt/blockstorage/nextcloud-data sudo chmod -R 750 /mnt/blockstorage/nextcloud-data sudo chmod g+s /mnt/blockstorage/nextcloud-data For good measure, restart Nginx \u0026amp; PHP:\nsudo systemctl restart nginx sudo systemctl restart php8.1-fpm Configure Trusted Domains # This lets you access your nextcloud from your domain. Run this:\nsudo nano /var/www/html/config/config.php Look for \u0026rsquo;trusted_domains\u0026rsquo; and modify it like the below example. It\u0026rsquo;s likely that it has 0 =\u0026gt; your-server-ip. So go to the next line and add your domain:\n\u0026#39;trusted_domains\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; array ( 0 =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;your-server-ip\u0026#39;, 1 =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;your-domain.com\u0026#39;, ), Secure your server with Let’s Encrypt SSL. It\u0026rsquo;s free and a good security practice. Run:\nsudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y sudo certbot --nginx -d your-domain.com Make sure to enable auto-renewal, too! You\u0026rsquo;ll make a cronjob, which has your system run a command every so often. Run:\nsudo crontab -e Add this line to the bottom:\n0 3 * * * certbot renew --quiet Create a New User with Full Access # For security, create a non-root user. Trust me, do it. It\u0026rsquo;s worth it.\nsudo adduser joshuagraves sudo usermod -aG sudo joshuagraves sudo chown -R joshuagraves:joshuagraves /mnt/blockstorage sudo chmod -R 770 /mnt/blockstorage sudo chmod g+s /mnt/blockstorage Transfer Files Efficiently # There are a few ways to get files into Nextcloud. One is by the web interface, which is fine. But sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s clunky and slow. If you can learn rsync and wget you\u0026rsquo;ll be in much better shape, as these run faster than the web interface does.\nTo use rsync, do this:\nrsync -ahv --progress -e \u0026quot;ssh\u0026quot; ~/Path/To/File joshuagraves@\u0026lt;SERVER_IP\u0026gt;:/mnt/blockstorage/nextcloud-data/YourUserID/files/Documents The first path is where your file is locally. The second is a command to log in via SSH for the non-root user we created and place it in a specified directory.\nYou can also use wget if there are files already accessible online. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t work with iCloud, or any other cloud drive that I\u0026rsquo;ve found. But if you have files on another server you own, this is the ticket:\ncd /mnt/blockstorage/nextcloud-data/YourUserID/files/ wget \u0026lt;file-url\u0026gt; Rescan Files in Nextcloud # It\u0026rsquo;s likely that you\u0026rsquo;ve uploaded a ton of files. It might\u0026rsquo;ve taken a while. For good measure, tell Nextcloud to detect new files:\nsudo -u www-data php /var/www/html/occ files:scan --all This can take a while. Mine went 10 minutes.\nTroubleshooting Permissions Issues # During setup, I had to update permissions multiple times. If you encounter errors like:\n“Your data directory is invalid.” “Target directory doesn’t exist.” “Permission denied when uploading files.” It means Nextcloud can’t write to these directories or something got wonky. Try running these commands:\nTo ensure the correct owner and group:\nsudo chown -R www-data:www-data /mnt/blockstorage/nextcloud-data To ensure the correct permissions:\nsudo chmod -R 750 /mnt/blockstorage/nextcloud-data sudo chmod g+s /mnt/blockstorage/nextcloud-data To restart services:\nsudo systemctl restart nginx sudo systemctl restart php8.1-fpm If you are moving large files manually via rsync or wget, rescan Nextcloud’s file system after fixing permissions:\nsudo -u www-data php /var/www/html/occ files:scan --all This should resolve most issues with files not appearing, permission errors, or Nextcloud not recognizing new uploads.\nAfterword # Nextcloud is a great self-hosted alternative to iCloud, Google Drive, or Dropbox. There\u0026rsquo;s a healthy ecosystem of free open source apps, like calendar, contacts, and mail to expand its functionality. It\u0026rsquo;s also got a task tracker.\nYou’ll want to make sure to read up on how to do maintenance, but for now, go into Nextcloud’s Administration Settings and set your updates to auto.\nHave fun!\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/knowledge/journal/self-reliant-tech/","title":"Self-Reliance \u0026 Tech","section":"Journal","content":"It’s so damned easy to find a service that will take your money and create a website for you, or use a cloud to host your project. But with ease comes trade-offs. Namely, creativity and self-reliance.\nWhen we use these tools, our expression and creativity become constrained by how the makers of the services crafted their tools. The medium shapes the message, as Marshall Mccluen said. And there’s usually little flexibility around that, as those makers (justifiably) have a vision to achieve and letting others tamper with that doesn’t jibe well with said vision.\nThe other loss is self-reliance. What happens if we forget how to make these digital things ourselves, the places we go for knowledge aren’t reliable or reachable, or an internet isn’t available?\nI don’t mean to imply everything will crash. That’s always possible, but what I’m saying is that I want to preserve the ability to craft and understand these technologies ourselves.\nOffline Knowledge # I built an offline knowledge database. It\u0026rsquo;s powered by Kiwix and has about 150GB of data, including all of wikipedia (as of 2023/08/01), everything from Project Gutenberg, and other personal info. All of this is open source, and I can plug this in anywhere, on any machine, and have instant access to the world\u0026rsquo;s knowledge. No ads, no tracking, no internet required.\nIf I decide to take this further, I\u0026rsquo;ll:\nLook into compiling the data so it\u0026rsquo;ll work on a low-power device like a kindle.

The retro feel and embracing of the small web was really interesting to me. After a couple of attempts, I gave up. The site loaded, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough of an expert to diagnose all the issues that come with debugging a mysql database and crawlers.\nIt was fun, and I felt really powerful there for a minute, churning through config files and creating databases and writing code myself. Maybe some other time I\u0026rsquo;ll come back to it.\nHosting # I’ve used Nextcloud in the past and have recently revived my interest in it. I want my own platform-agnostic cloud.

Not one that helps me be incredibly productive or something I’m not.

It sets people up to fail before they even start. “Am I doing this right? Can I sit still for hours?” This is enough to give anyone a complex.\nIt doesn’t have to be like that. Because that’s not what mindfulness is. The truth of mindfulness is that it’s so much more accessible than you’d be led to believe. I know people would love to sell you products that they masquerade as the solution to your problems, but it’s a very pretty, very pricey lie.\nWhat mindfulness isn’t # So much of what you see doesn’t match reality. Everyone wants to sell you something.\nWhat you see on magazine covers # It isn’t what you see on magazine covers and articles. There’s not anyone who’s living their best life just meditating and being zen with crystal bowls everywhere.\nThere’s nothing wrong with meditation, sound healing, or a peaceful aesthetic, in fact it’s great to curate those things if they’re available to you. But you can do just fine with what you’ve got.\nIt goes wrong when you get twisted up trying to curate a perfect, Instagrammable version of calm. It’s not limited to sitting cross-legged on a cushion. Meditation is a tool, not the tool. Mindfulness doesn’t require any particular accessories or external conditions. If it did, people in war zones, stressful jobs, or grief wouldn’t have access to it—and yet, they do.\nHaving a peaceful, unbothered life # If your goal is to never be disturbed, triggered, or upset, you’re setting yourself up for suffering. And you’ll make yourself suffer more by believing you can avoid it.\nLife will challenge you. People will irritate you. Situations will push you outside your comfort zone. It’s because seeking only peace creates rigidity and brittleness—an inability to deal with the discomfort of reality. True mindfulness is about being present with whatever is, not just what feels good.\nAn escape # I’ve alluded to this earlier, but we see purchasing things or experiences as keys to unlocking a better life. We see scrolling endlessly through our phones as a retreat to peace, but really it’s a numbing mechanism. Sometimes you have to be numb when the only alternative is to be attacked and in pain. But it can’t be the norm.\nAvoiding the present by consuming more doesn’t work. It’s like eating more when you’re already full, you’ll only build discomfort for yourself. Being informed is one thing, but compulsive use is the opposite of presence—it traps you in cycles of anxiety and reaction rather than conscious awareness.\nMindfulness is # The truth of mindfulness is way more boring and less marketable. But the benefits are still there, you can live a more present and fulfilling life by taking these into mind. They’re really about grounding, about connecting you to yourself and the world around you.\nWalking # Not just getting from point A to B, but really walking—feeling the weight of your feet on the ground, the air on your skin, the rhythm of your breath. Walking mindfully transforms a mundane act into a grounding practice.\nPainting # You don’t need to be an artist to paint mindfully. The act of mixing colors, feeling the brush move, and letting the process unfold without judgment is mindfulness in action. It’s about presence, not perfection.\nDancing # Not performing, not worrying about how it looks—just moving with your body, feeling the music, letting movement emerge naturally. Dance is one of the most embodied forms of mindfulness because it forces you into the present moment. Overthinking kills it; feeling sustains it.\nSinging # Breathing deeply, using your voice, vibrating sound through your body—all of this brings you into the moment. You don’t have to be good at it. Mindfulness isn’t about being “good” at something; it’s about being with something.\nA process of emptying and sitting with yourself # Mindfulness isn’t about adding more—it’s about subtracting. Letting go of distractions, expectations, and noise. Sitting with yourself—not always comfortably, but honestly. Sometimes, what arises isn’t pleasant. But mindfulness teaches you to meet yourself where you are, without running away.\nMindfulness at its core is presence. No control, no perfection, no aesthetic—just being here, sitting with the mess.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/knowledge/ideas/2025-01-20/","title":"New Beginnings","section":"Ideas","content":"I spent the last year living in Joshua Tree, CA.

Observation vs. Evaluation: Learning to separate facts from judgments to improve mutual understanding Other Highlights # As NVC replaces our old patterns of defending, withdrawing, or attacking in the face of judgment and criticism, we come to perceive ourselves and others, as well as our intentions and relationships, in a new light. Resistance, defensiveness, and violent reactions are minimized. When we focus on clarifying what is being observed, felt, and needed rather than on diagnosing and judging, we discover the depth of our own compassion. Through its emphasis on deep listening—to ourselves as well as to others—NVC fosters respect, attentiveness, and empathy and engenders a mutual desire to give from the heart. it is important to keep in mind that NVC is not a set formula, but something that adapts to various situations as well as personal and cultural styles. Moralistic Judgments One kind of life-alienating communication is the use of moralistic judgments that imply wrongness or badness on the part of people who don’t act in harmony with our values. Such judgments are reflected in language: “The problem with you is that you’re too selfish.” “She’s lazy.” “They’re prejudiced.” “It’s inappropriate.” Blame, insults, put-downs, labels, criticism, comparisons, and diagnoses are all forms of judgment. “Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and right-doing, there is a field. I’ll meet you there.” Analyses of others are actually expressions of our own needs and values. It does not surprise me to hear that there is considerably less violence in cultures where people think in terms of human needs than in cultures where people label one another as “good” or “bad” and believe that the “bad” ones deserve to be punished. We deny responsibility for our actions when we attribute their cause to factors outside ourselves: Vague, impersonal forces—“I cleaned my room because I had to.” Our condition, diagnosis, or personal or psychological history—“I drink because I am an alcoholic.” The actions of others—“I hit my child because he ran into the street.” The dictates of authority—“I lied to the client because the boss told me to.” Group pressure—“I started smoking because all my friends did.” Thinking based on “who deserves what” blocks compassionate communication. The language of wrongness, should, and have to is perfectly suited for this purpose: the more people are trained to think in terms of moralistic judgments that imply wrongness and badness, the more they are being trained to look outside themselves—to outside authorities—for the definition of what constitutes right, wrong, good, and bad. The first component of NVC entails the separation of observation from evaluation. We need to clearly observe what we are seeing, hearing, or touching that is affecting our sense of well-being, without mixing in any evaluation. NVC does not mandate that we remain completely objective and refrain from evaluating. It only requires that we maintain a separation between our observations and our evaluations. The Indian philosopher J. Krishnamurti once remarked that observing without evaluating is the highest form of human intelligence. We subsequently worked together to create a list identifying specific behaviors, on the part of the principal, that bothered them, and made sure that the list was free of evaluation. Exercise 1 OBSERVATION OR EVALUATION? To determine your proficiency at discerning between observations and evaluations, complete the following exercise. Circle the number in front of each statement that is an observation only, with no evaluation mixed in. My expression of vulnerability had a pronounced effect on the students. They started to ask questions about me, to tell me things about themselves, and to express curiosity about NVC. Judgments of others are alienated expressions of our own unmet needs. Unfortunately, most of us have never been taught to think in terms of needs. We are accustomed to thinking about what’s wrong with other people when our needs aren’t being fulfilled. Thus, if we want coats to be hung up in the closet, we may characterize our children as lazy for leaving them on the couch. Or we may interpret our co-workers as irresponsible when they don’t go about their tasks the way we would prefer them to. I was once invited to Southern California to mediate between some landowners and migrant farm workers whose conflicts had grown increasingly hostile and violent. I began the meeting by asking these two questions: “What is it that you are each needing? And what would you like to request of the other in relation to these needs?” In this case, the woman could have responded to the mukhtar in terms of her own needs and requests by saying, for example, “I am needing more respect in our dialogue. Instead of telling us how you think we are acting, would you tell us what it is we are doing that you find disturbing?” It has been my experience over and over again that from the moment people begin talking about what they need rather than what’s wrong with one another, the possibility of finding ways to meet everybody’s needs is greatly increased. The following are some of the basic human needs we all share: At the third stage, emotional liberation, we respond to the needs of others out of compassion, never out of fear, guilt, or shame. Our actions are therefore fulfilling to us, as well as to those who receive our efforts. We accept full responsibility for our own intentions and actions, but not for the feelings of others. At this stage, we are aware that we can never meet our own needs at the expense of others. Emotional liberation involves stating clearly what we need in a way that communicates we are equally concerned that the needs of others be fulfilled. Use positive language when making requests. Making requests in clear, positive, concrete action language reveals what we really want. A similar lack of clarity occurred between a father and his fifteen-year-old son when they came in for counseling. “All I want is for you to start showing a little responsibility,” claimed the father. “Is that asking too much?” I suggested that he specify what it would take for his son to demonstrate the responsibility he was seeking. After a discussion on how to clarify his request, the father responded sheepishly, “Well, it doesn’t sound so good, but when I say that I want responsibility, what I really mean is that I want him to do what I ask, without question—to jump when I say jump, and to smile while doing it.” He then agreed with me that if his son were to actually behave this way, it would demonstrate obedience rather than responsibility. Requests may sound like demands when unaccompanied by the speaker’s feelings and needs. When I emphasize the importance of our ability to ask for reflections, people often express reservations. They are worried about reactions like, “What do you think I am—deaf?” or, “Quit playing your psychological games.” To prevent such responses, we can explain to people ahead of time why we may sometimes ask them to reflect back our words. We make clear that we’re not testing their listening skills, but checking out whether we’ve expressed ourselves clearly. However, should the listener retort, “I heard what you said; I’m not stupid!” we have the option to focus on the listener’s feelings and needs and ask—either aloud or silently—“Are you saying you’re feeling annoyed because you want respect for your ability to understand things?” Sometimes we’d like to know something about our listener’s thoughts in response to what they just heard us say. At these times, it’s important to specify which thoughts we’d like them to share. For example, we might say, “I’d like you to tell me if you predict that my proposal would be successful, and if not, what you believe would prevent its success,” rather than simply saying, “I’d like you to tell me what you think about what I’ve said.” When we don’t specify which thoughts we would like to receive, the other person may respond at great length with thoughts that aren’t the ones we are seeking. Expressing genuine requests also requires an awareness of our objective. If our objective is only to change people and their behavior or to get our way, then NVC is not an appropriate tool. The process is designed for those of us who would like others to change and respond, but only if they choose to do so willingly and compassionately. The objective of NVC is to establish a relationship based on honesty and empathy. When others trust that our primary commitment is to the quality of the relationship, and that we expect this process to fulfill everyone’s needs, then they can trust that our requests are true requests and not camouflaged demands. The Chinese philosopher Chuang-Tzu stated that true empathy requires listening with the whole being: “The hearing that is only in the ears is one thing. The hearing of the understanding is another. But the hearing of the spirit is not limited to any one faculty, to the ear, or to the mind. Hence it demands the emptiness of all the faculties. And when the faculties are empty, then the whole being listens. There is then a direct grasp of what is right there before you that can never be heard with the ear or understood with the mind.” intellectual understanding of a problem blocks the kind of presence that empathy requires. The way I expressed my choice—which in this situation turned out to be helpful—was not so much through what I said, but through what I did. Instead of judging him as lying, I tried to hear his feeling: he was scared, and his need was to protect himself from being punished. By empathizing with him, I had a chance of making an emotional connection out of which we could both get our needs met. However, if I had approached him with the view that he was lying—even if I hadn’t expressed it out loud—he would have been less likely to feel safe expressing truthfully what had happened. I would have then become part of the process: by the very act of judging another person as a liar, I would contribute to a self-fulfilling prophecy. Why would people want to tell the truth, knowing they will be judged and punished for doing so? With a broader perspective, however, we realize that each time our needs are met in this way, we not only lose, but we have contributed very tangibly to violence on the planet. We may have solved an immediate problem, but we will have created another one. The more people hear blame and judgment, the more defensive and aggressive they become and the less they will care about our needs in the future. Four Steps to Expressing Anger when you make the connection, the problem solves itself most of the time. Many of us have great difficulty expressing our needs: we have been taught by society to criticize, insult, and otherwise (mis)communicate in ways that keep us apart. In a conflict, both parties usually spend too much time intent on proving themselves right, and the other party wrong, rather than paying attention to their own and the other’s needs. And such verbal conflicts can far too easily escalate into violence—and even war. I asked the husband what needs of his weren’t being fulfilled in the marriage. He said, “I need to get out of this marriage.” What he was describing was a specific person (himself) taking a specific action (leaving the marriage). He wasn’t expressing a need; he was identifying a strategy. “I’m aware that you’re both in a lot of pain. Let’s begin with each of you expressing whatever needs of yours aren’t being fulfilled in your relationship. Once you understand each other’s needs, I’m confident we can work on strategies to meet those needs.” To resolve conflicts using NVC, we need to train ourselves to hear people expressing needs regardless of how they do the expressing. So this is our work: learning to recognize the need in statements that don’t overtly express any need. It takes practice, and it always involves some guessing. By my definition, a need doesn’t refer to a specific action, such as spending or not spending money. When either side hears itself criticized, diagnosed, or interpreted, the energy of the situation will likely turn toward self-defense and counter-accusations rather than toward resolution. When people are upset, they often need empathy before they can hear what is being said to them. instead of trying to have her repeat what her husband had said, I tried to understand the pain she was in—the pain that kept her from hearing him. Especially if there is a long history of pain, it is important to offer enough empathy so that the parties feel reassured that their pain is being recognized and understood. People often need empathy before they are able to hear what is being said. If we could just say, “Here are the needs of both sides. Here are the resources. What can be done to meet these needs?,” conflicts would be easily resolved. But instead, our thinking is focused on dehumanizing one another with labels and judgments until even the simplest of conflicts becomes very difficult to solve. Non-action language, such as “Give me the freedom to grow” often exacerbates conflict. In this instance, the husband heard himself being judged as domineering. I pointed out to the wife that it wasn’t clear to her husband what she wanted: “Please tell him exactly what you’d like him to do to meet your need to have your choices respected.” NVC and the Mediator Role Although in this chapter I have offered examples from mediations I’ve facilitated between conflicting parties, the focus so far has been on how to apply these skills when resolving conflicts between ourselves and another person. There are, however, a few things to keep in mind at those times when we want to use our NVC tools to help two other parties reach a resolution and we take on the role of mediator. When we witness behaviors that raise concern in us—unless it is a situation that calls for the protective use of force as described in Chapter 12—the first thing we do is to empathize with the needs of the person who is behaving in the way we dislike. In the first situation, if we wanted to see more violence directed at the toddler, we could, instead of offering empathy to the mother, say something to imply that she was wrong to hit the child. Such a response on our part would only escalate the situation. We do not hear “no” as a rejection but rather as an expression of the need that is keeping the person from saying “yes.” "},{"id":5,"href":"/knowledge/guides/code/","title":"Code Snippets","section":"Knowledge","content":" Sync everything in a folder to a remote server: # rsync -ahv --progress -e \u0026#34;ssh\u0026#34; ~/path/to/file/ user@SERVER_IP:/path/to/folder/ Copy all text from a PDF into a TXT file: # pdftotext -layout file.pdf Convert image formats: # mogrify -format webp -quality 90 *.jpeg "},{"id":6,"href":"/knowledge/book-notes/cptsd/","title":"CPTSD, From Surviving to Thriving","section":"Book Notes","content":"This book focuses on integrating and healing from trauma from complex post traumatic stress disorder. Focuses on inner child work, reparenting, and facing your shadow.\nOther Highlights # Fire is the sun unwinding itself out of the wood. There are also various somatic therapies that can help our bodies heal. As with my earlier comments about CBT, I encourage you to be wary of somatic approaches that claim to heal Cptsd without working on the cognitive and emotional levels described above. Some approaches, in fact, blanketly dismiss cognitive work in a way that sidesteps the crucial work of shrinking the inner critic. Some approaches also believe that their techniques eliminate the fundamental necessity of grieving the losses of childhood, and understanding how abusive and negligent parenting is at the root of our problems. Self-criticism, then, runs non-stop in a desperate attempt to avoid rejection-inducing mistakes. Drasticizing becomes obsessive to help the child foresee and avoid punishment and worsening abandonment. At the same time, it continuously fills her psyche with stories and images of catastrophe. Early abuse and abandonment forces the child to merge his identity with the superego, the part of the child’s brain that learns the rules of his caretakers in order to get and maintain acceptance. However, because acceptance is impossible in the Cptsd-engendering family, the superego gets stuck working overtime to achieve the impossible. Perseverating on finding a formula to win over her parents, the child eventually embraces perfectionism as a strategy to make her parents less dangerous and more engaging. Her one hope is that if she becomes smart, helpful, pretty, and flawless enough, her parents will finally care for her. The above is of course a blatant example of the slaughtering of emotional expression. Just as common is the insidious, passive-aggressive assault on emoting which is seen in the parent who shuns her child for expressing his feelings. This is seen in the emotionally abandoning parent who sequesters the child in a timeout for crying, or routinely retreats from the crying child into her room. Cptsd-engendering parents often hypocritically attack their children’s emotional expression in a bi-modal way. This occurs when the child is both abused for emoting and is, at the same time, abused by her caretaker’s toxic emotional expression. The inner critic is sometimes so hostile to grieving that shrinking the critic may need to be your first recovery priority. Until the critic is sufficiently tamed, grieving can actually make flashbacks worse, rather than perform the restorative processes it alone can initiate. Psychologically speaking, mindfulness is taking undistracted time to become fully aware of your thoughts and feelings so that you can have more choice in how you respond to them. Do I really agree with this thought, or have I been pressured into believing it? How do I want to respond to this feeling – distract myself from it, repress it, express it or just feel it until it changes into something else? Sometimes this is most poignantly described as not being liked by your parents, which belies the many Cptsd-inducing parents who say they love their children, but demonstrate in a thousand ways that they do not like them. “The sight of you makes me sick” was very popular with such parents when I was growing up. When our emotional intelligence is restricted, we often do not know what we really want, and can consequently struggle mightily with even the smallest decisions. The rejecting responses of our parents to our emotional expression alienate us from our feelings. Emotional abuse/neglect scares us out of our own emotions while simultaneously making us terrified of other people’s feelings. Those who cannot feel their sadness often do not know when they are being unfairly excluded, and those who cannot feel their normal angry or fearful responses to abuse, are often in danger of putting up with it without protest. Many survivors benefit greatly from classes and books on assertiveness training Or, I say that, if I could, I would take him back to live with me in the future before all those horrible things could happen to him.

Many great innovations get started in a reframe. In design thinking we always say, “Don’t start with the problem, start with the people, start with empathy.” But before you can figure out which direction to head in, you need to know where you are and what design problems you are trying to solve. In design thinking, we put as much emphasis on problem finding as we do on problem solving. Our problems become our story, and we can all get stuck in our stories. Deciding which problems to work on may be one of the most important decisions you make, because people can lose years (or a lifetime) working on the wrong problem. “I want to go back to school and become a doctor, but it will take me at least ten years, and I don’t want to invest that much time at this stage of my life. What do I do about it?” These are all gravity problems—meaning they are not real problems. Why? Because in life design, if it’s not actionable, it’s not a problem. Let’s repeat that. If it’s not actionable, it’s not a problem. It’s a situation, a circumstance, a fact of life. It may be a drag (so to speak), but, like gravity, it’s not a problem that can be solved. it’s impossible to predict the future. And the corollary to that thought is: once you design something, it changes the future that is possible. Anytime you start to feel your life is not working, or you’re going through a major transition, it’s good to do a compass calibration. We do them at least once a year. Dysfunctional Belief: Work is not supposed to be enjoyable; that’s why they call it work. Reframe: Enjoyment is a guide to finding the right work for you. Remember that designers have a bias to action—which is just another way of saying that we pay a lot of attention to doing things, and not just to thinking about things. Activity Log (where I record where I’m engaged and energized) • Reflections (where I discover what I am learning) Note:update you report\u0026rsquo;s form for this Quantity has a quality all its own. In life design, more is better, because more ideas equal access to better ideas, and better ideas lead to a better design. Expanding your thinking improves your ability to ideate and allows for more innovation. Designers learn to have lots of wild ideas because they know that the number one enemy of creativity is judgment. As a life designer, you need to embrace two philosophies: You choose better when you have lots of good ideas to choose from. You never choose your first solution to any problem. With help, Melanie got unstuck by adopting a design thinking mind-set, remembering what her real problem was, and exploring some prototypes. Don’t make a doable problem into an anchor problem by wedding yourself irretrievably to a solution that just isn’t working. It is okay for prototypes to fail—they are supposed to—but well-designed prototypes teach you something about the future. You are legion. Each of us is many. This life you are living is one of many lives you will live. Working with adults of all ages, we’ve found that where people go wrong (regardless of their age, education, or career path) is thinking they just need to come up with a plan for their lives and it will be smooth sailing. If only they make the right choice (the best, true, only choice), they will have a blueprint for who they will be, what they will do, and how they will live. It’s a paint-by-numbers approach to life, but in reality, life is more of an abstract painting—one that’s open to multiple interpretations. Chung had learned life design. He had tools he could use, and accepted that there was more than one happy path he could chart his life by. Dysfunctional Belief: I need to figure out my best possible life, make a plan, and then execute it. Reframe: There are multiple great lives (and plans) within me, and I get to choose which one to build my way forward to next. One started with three ideas in parallel, Note:This is how my brain should work The conclusion is that if your mind starts with multiple ideas in parallel, it is not prematurely committed to one path and stays more open and able to receive and “Building is thinking” At Stanford, we believe anything can be prototyped, from a physical object to public policy. When you are trying to solve a problem, any problem, you typically start with what you know about the problem: you start with the data. You need enough data so that you can understand what causes what, and what is likely to happen when something else happens. Note:design thinking in a nutshell Prototypes help you visualize alternatives in a very experiential way. Not only is it true that doing prototyping is a good idea; it’s equally true that not prototyping is a bad and sometimes very costly idea. "},{"id":8,"href":"/knowledge/journal/intentions/","title":"On Intentions","section":"Journal","content":"To come up with intentions—ones that stick and aren’t laced with negative motivators—isn’t as tough as it sounds.\nAt some point in your life, you’ll find yourself wanting to set intentions. Maybe it’s a New Year’s resolution. Or perhaps you’ve ended one chapter of your life to start another and want to shift your mindset.\nAdvice on this is all over the map, and much of it is bad. You’ll hear that intentions can manifest your dreams or that you can will yourself out of a bad situation. Others will tell you that if you don’t believe hard enough, it won’t happen.\nIn 2024, I attended a meditation retreat with Eden Tull and Enrique Collazo. Both teachers are deeply practiced and have a wealth of wisdom to draw from. They offered the most sound advice on creating intentions I’ve ever encountered. While the process unfolded over four days, I’ll attempt to distill it into this post.\nThe process begins with listing your victories, losses, and lessons learned. It encourages self-compassion and thoughtful inquiry into any limiting beliefs you hold, along with understanding the impact of those beliefs. The most powerful aspect of the process was turning those limiting beliefs into an antidote—a declaration you can carry with you.\n1. List Your Victories # Don’t worry about the order or whether something “deserves” to be on the list. Once you’re done, reflect on which ones were the most impactful to you.\nIn 2024, I had a lot going on, and I filled seven pages of bullet points. That year was full of achievements—things I’d always wanted to do.\n2. List Your Losses # Alongside your wins are your losses. These can be challenging to list, but it’s important to take an objective look and avoid attaching a narrative. Stick to the facts. It might be hard, but you’ll find it worthwhile.\nMy list took up about two pages.\n3. Create Some Self-Compassion # After listing your losses, take a moment to offer yourself compassion. If you’re like me, you may not do this often, even if you’re quick to offer it to others.\nStart by asking yourself: “Which parts of me are here?”\nIf you’re going through something difficult—like a divorce or a loss—you might notice parts such as:\nThe hurt one The ruminating one The scared one I think of these as my “inner family,” each part playing a role in my life, complete with its own dynamics. They’re aspects of your personality, not your entire identity. Other examples might include:\nThe doer The fixer The helper The parent The child During a session, I shared how my drive to achieve and solve sometimes steals joy from the present moment. The instructors reframed this kindly, reminding me these are parts of me—not my whole identity. The distinction is subtle but profound: what you’ve lost or gone through is not your identity. You may be a survivor, but you’re also much more. Defining yourself solely by these things can make it harder to embrace other aspects of who you are.\nNext, ask yourself what you’d say to these parts if they were loved ones. To the hurt one, you might say: “You did your best. I love you. Keep going.” To the ruminating one: “You have five minutes of my attention. Say what you need to, and then we’re moving on.”\nTreat these parts with loving-kindness. Pushing them away only strengthens their hold.\n4. Not All Compassion Is Gentle # While kindness is essential, not every part of you requires gentleness. Sometimes, you must be firm—what the instructors called “fierce compassion.”\nConsider when a beloved pet is doing something potentially destructive to them or something else. You may shout to make them stop. It isn\u0026rsquo;t because you don\u0026rsquo;t love them, but sometimes gentleness doesn\u0026rsquo;t cut it.\nSome aspects of yourself need similar decisive boundaries. Parts that might need this include:\nThe hurtful one The hateful one The destructive one The vengeful one Anything destructive to yourself or others doesn’t deserve the spotlight. Fierce compassion ensures guilt, shame, or resentment don’t take root.\n5. List Your Major Lessons From 2024 # Synthesize your victories, losses, and insights from self-compassion. Here are two examples from my own list:\n“You can give all your love and sacrifice everything for someone, but it’s not guaranteed to fix the situation. Love is limitless, but its power isn’t.” “Hold your boundaries.” Avoid clichés or Hallmark-style sentiments. This is for you, not for show.\n6. Identify Your Limiting Beliefs # To uncover these beliefs, ask: “Does this limit my agency, intelligence, or autonomy?”\nThis step requires deep reflection. Examples of limiting beliefs might include:\n“To be loved, I must hide my flaws.” “I am broken by default.” “Working hard enough can solve any problem.” Address the Impact of These Beliefs # Examine how each belief affects your relationships—with yourself, others, and your work. For example: does a hyperactive problem-solver in you sap joy from the present moment? (I speak from experience.)\n7. What’s Your Heart’s Desire? # Having identified your lessons, losses, and limiting beliefs, ask yourself: What do I truly want? What feels most authentic? Examples might include:\n“To be free, safe, and light.” “To show up in the spirit of collective transformation.” Tender, profound, or even mundane—what matters is its authenticity.\n8. Ask What You Need to Let Go Of # Reflect on your losses and limiting beliefs. What blocks your heart’s desire? Is it attachment to outcomes? Unrealistic expectations? The idea that problems are solvable without acceptance?\nList a few. Keep it to five or fewer.\n9. Create an Antidote # Turn a limiting belief into a declaration. For instance, if your belief is “Working hard enough can solve any problem,” the antidote might be: I meet all that life presents me from a place of peace and strength.”\nHere’s another example. If your limiting belief is that you won\u0026rsquo;t be accepted for who you are unless you hide the flaws, your declaration may be “I allow myself to be seen and loved as I am.”\nWrite it as if it’s already true. Avoid negative motivators or wishful thinking.\nClosing # Intentions are powerful. They’ve unquestionably changed my life. But remember, they can’t guarantee outcomes. You can’t wish yourself out of hardship, nor fake it until you make it.\nThat’s why declarations like “I meet all that life presents me from a place of peace and strength\u0026quot; matter. They don’t eliminate problems—they help you face them without needless suffering.\nIntentions aren’t magic. They’re a permission slip to be your authentic self. Write yours down. Post it somewhere visible. Let it be a touchstone in your mindfulness practice.\n"},{"id":9,"href":"/knowledge/ideas/2023-12-12/","title":"Feeding your demons","section":"Ideas","content":"I’ve long wondered if fighting off your demons, waging battle after battle against your problems, is the best approach. It’s energy intensive and often feels like you’re fighting the tide.\nAs someone with complex post traumatic stress disorder, I felt exhaustion in the marrow of my bones after wading into some of these battles. Maybe I beat back something or achieved some small victory, but it felt like a losing proposition that came at great cost.\nAs one who strives for non-violence in communication and other parts of life, I felt the need to see if a similar strategy existed for healing spiritual wounds. One that is a little more introspective and could perhaps redirect energy instead of directly countering it.\nAfter all, these demons exist for a reason, why not see if you can understand them and their motivations? How’d they get there, what’s their purpose? Why are they so difficult to get past?\nIt was a few weeks ago that book called Feeding Your Demons came across my screen that articulates such a concept. It’s by a Tibetan yogi, Milarepa (1052–1135), and it’s exactly what I was seeking. She describes the idea like this:\nThe malignant [\u0026hellip;] demons Who create myriad troubles and obstructions Seem real before one has reached enlightenment. But when one realizes their true nature, They become Protectors, And through their help and assistance One attains numerous accomplishments.\nThe alternative to feeding our demons is to engage in a conflict we can never win: our unfed demons only become more and more powerful and monstrous as we either openly battle them or remain ignorant of their undercover operations.\nIf you’re wondering, these demons aren’t little imps with pitchforks. Turns out around 1200 CE they took on a different meaning as the Church began to gain more influence around the world. Machig describes them like this:\n“What we call demons are not materially existing individuals with huge black forms, frightening and terrifying anyone who sees them. A demon means anything which hinders liberation.”\nI’ll be curious to see what the rest of the book offers. It’s off to an incredible start.\n"},{"id":10,"href":"/knowledge/ideas/2023-11-30/","title":"Wax stamps","section":"Ideas","content":"Used a wax stamp for the first time to address thank-you cards.

From Wikipedia:\nIn hindsight, the basic idea at the heart of the incompleteness theorem is rather simple. Gödel essentially constructed a formula that claims that it is unprovable in a given formal system. If it were provable, it would be false. Thus there will always be at least one true but unprovable statement. That is, for any computably enumerable set of axioms for arithmetic (that is, a set that can in principle be printed out by an idealized computer with unlimited resources), there is a formula that is true of arithmetic, but which is not provable in that system. To make this precise, however, Gödel needed to produce a method to encode (as natural numbers) statements, proofs, and the concept of provability; he did this using a process known as Gödel numbering.\nMarkdown to Word Doc Conversion from Notion # Lastly, for Notion users: I found a way to convert the .md files that Notion exports to word doc files.

Mostly people act out of pain, things they haven’t processed or integrated yet. This doesn’t separate the act from the impact, to be clear. “If you consider hell a state of mind, then hell is all around us.” The agreements we make are inherited and taught. These are not always authentic to ourselves. “You don’t need to blame your parents for teaching you to be like them. What else could they teach you but what you know?

Healing happens in moments as simple and profound as this, when we are able to tolerate, feel, and express something in our relationships that before was out of our reach. survival does not necessarily ensure resilience. One of our elders, Alta Starr, would say that instead of thinking about resilience as the way we cope after trauma, we should think of it as our birthright, how we come into this world. To be resilient is to be engaged, creative, adaptive, and relational. It’s to remember that you are a part of this world. Healing is not a place you can arrive to. And whatever you call it, it is the ongoing work of enlivening our interiors, waking up our souls. Healing is an orientation to living rather than a destination. Healing is not an easy process. The things that suffocate us and haunt us are persistent and pervasive. Between a rock and a hard place is no place to live. Others would rather stay focused on justice than come home to face whatever unresolved tension or pain they carry. Healing ourselves is not the end of the line but brings us into relationship with others, and allows us to do the work that brings healing to the wider world. I told myself that I wouldn’t follow anyone whose vision for the future didn’t show up in their day-to-day life in how they cared for themselves and the people around them. Can healing reach through the weeks, and months, and years, and free us? I believe something comes back to us when we listen to and hold one another and when we take time to learn ourselves and tend to what we find. Through healing we can change both the past and the future. I touch my own skin, and it tells me that before there was any harm, there was miracle. “And what’s the cost,” she asked, looking up, “of stopping the tears?” “I’m safe enough to feel what needs to come.” Behaviors become automatic with enough repetition. Here are some principles that guide me and that I’ll discuss at greater length during the chapter: What we practice, what we do over time, can eventually become automatic; that is, it no longer requires our thinking to execute. We just do it. Something is truly learned when it is embodied (whether it’s riding a bicycle or having the capacity to trust someone). What we embody may be aligned or misaligned with our values or may be helpful or harmful to us as we learn and embody practices both consciously and unconsciously over time. We can build our awareness of what it is we do automatically, how we do it, and how it came to be—which gives us the possibility to change. We can increase our ability to feel our emotions rather than deny them and allow ourselves to feel what we deeply long for in ourselves and the world. To transform and become who we intend to be more often, we have to practice being who we are becoming. But knowing something alone does not produce changed behavior, and when we try to impose new ideas on a body that has its own logic and cares, they won’t When we rely so heavily on our thinking as the sole basis for healing, we miss the resource, the wisdom, and the reality of our bodies. I spoke through my body to the nothingness, letting it devour me and birth me again. But our reactions always answer to a memory. Reactivity and the binaries of threat and safety limit what it is we are able to dream and experience in our lives. Some things seem too big to be felt alone because they are. Studying somatics awakened in me the proposition that I might not need to tame my body. Our society has gone through too many traumas while commanding that we deny our grief and our compassion. Our feeling of it all. Our processing of it and getting to the other side, bringing our new insight into ourselves along with us. Healing always happens through relationship, whether it is relationship with a therapist, a tree, or a grandmother. Inauthenticity is sometimes rewarded. It’s a set of defenses learned over time. Many of us learned over time that it was safer to make our own needs secondary to keep someone else happy. When we focus so much on someone else’s contentment, we can deprioritize and quiet our own feeling. We lose a sense of who we really are other than who we need to become for another’s sake. When we give ourselves away so often, we can start to believe that who we really are is the guilt and shame we feel on the other side of those interactions, which only reinforces our self-abandonment. “Boundaries are the distance at which I can love you and me simultaneously.” Over the years, despite the evidence of repeated past disappointments, my hurt feelings had held on to the idea that my father might, or at least should, change, and my rage had spawned more from the heartbreak of him not meeting my needs than from any lingering damage from his behavior. I had wanted him to acknowledge his mistakes. To apologize and make things right. So for years I had fought with him, and even when I stopped speaking to him, I had fought him in my mind until I found the strength to accept that he might never change. And it was then that the foundation cracked and the walls came tumbling down. I grieved. For the child who had never felt safe, who had internalized that they were unlovable because they’d never felt love in the way they dreamed it was possible. Finally, I felt the emotions I had been protecting myself from, that I had stopped myself from feeling, and it made room for me to get down to the work of tending to myself. I started to crave a different kind of love, love that didn’t require me to question my lovability or to try to make myself lovable for someone else. Love that strived to meet my needs. Most important, I started a primary relationship with myself and learned how to attend to me. I took myself out and did things that I liked. I took responsibility for myself, my anger, and my joy. I learned how to maintain my integrity, not compromise In my pep talk to myself in the car outside the diner, I kept saying, I choose what to share, I choose what I respond to, I choose when to leave. again. I was trying to keep his words out of me. All of this may be inherited, or it may be learned, but all of it can be remade. The choice is ours. We reach for one another from the beginning. Charles Feltman, author of The Thin Book of Trust, defines trust this way, as choosing to make something you value vulnerable to another person’s actions. Because of how we’ve seen people use the power we give them, we assume that power is only domination and exclusion, not generosity and protection. We create the family structures we need. We have grandmothers who are second mothers, cousins who are more like siblings, and uncles our own age. James Baldwin wrote: “Each of us, helplessly and forever, contains the other—male in female, female in male, white in black and black in white. We are a part of each other. Many of my countrymen appear to find this fact exceedingly inconvenient and even unfair, and so, very often, do I.

Fixing, after all, is just another way to stop feeling. if we are unwilling to feel for someone in their grief, we are, in essence, unwilling to know them and know ourselves. And if we are unwilling to know someone, if we’d rather keep a safe distance through sympathy or apathy, we likely won’t know how to have their back when it counts. I was tempted to provide a checklist of tasks and tips on how to be a great ally or accomplice in the fight for justice, but any lists you need have already been written. And to be honest, I believe they provide cover for the deeper transformation, the fundamental change that is necessary for their advice to stick. We don’t really change on account of good ideas, no matter how much we may wish to, or because we hope to be perceived as politically correct, or even because we truly want to find a way to make things better. none of them ever hit home until I showed people that gender is not something that only queer people are afflicted with, that gender is an experience all of us are navigating at any point in time. We are already kin, whether we like it or not. So how can we live as though our living depends on one another? Another’s pain can never relieve our own. Often the scale of our reaction and how imminently we perceive the threat directly correlate to how much residue we hold from the past and how much or how little healing we’ve done. Our past can maintain a hold on us that amplifies slights and misattunements, that judges events as crises even when they are not. Neither innocence nor guilt can describe a person, as they are not identity traits or accurate descriptors of who we are in relationship, and yet we treat them that they are not grasping for understanding, but for the safety of innocence. Innocence, as our society uses it, is not a concept created for true safety and care. It is mostly a way to safeguard against responsibility. When we strive toward proving our innocence, we protect ourselves from really understanding our roles.

It\u0026rsquo;s a living document that outlines where one has been, and a tool that advises where one could go.\nHow\u0026rsquo;s this built? # I use Hugo, a static site generator. There\u0026rsquo;s no fancy CMS, it’s just Markdown-powered text files and the site is served by GitHub pages. The only meaningful Javascript here powers a search feature, so that means no trackers here either. I reserve the right to add sparkling via Javascript.\nThere are other constraints. I won’t be adding flashy animations, adding layouts, and only allowing minimal imagery. I’ll indulge myself with nice typefaces though, because I love them so.\nIn the future, I\u0026rsquo;ll be focusing on making it even easier and greener to load, adding image dithering and hopefully attempting to most entirely to green, solar-powered hosting.\n"},{"id":34,"href":"/projects/interstellar/","title":"Interstellar Spray Paint Textures","section":"Projects","content":" Buy it at Creative Market Add a little cosmic action to your next design project with these 10 hand-made spray paint textures.\nThey\u0026rsquo;re huge, grayscale webps that you can drop into any project, mask, and color in no time.

I’m forever pining for a laptop that I can upgrade and repair if I want. Ultimate Hacking Keyboard: It’s a split keyboard that sounds delightful and feels better to type on. I opted for the hand rests and the mouse extension. I’ll never ever go back to a regular keyboard again. Magic Trackpad: I had wrist trouble, and it was less motion for me to use than a heavy mouse. I’m big on gestures, so this is nice. Apps # Sublime Text: It has some nice integrations. I don’t have to go too deep with this app for what I do, but I like its find and replace functionality. Especially the regex features. Terminal: I’m not a full-time engineer by any measure. So this does just fine for me. I did up the font size, find a nice monospaced font, and made it black and green. You know, for vibes. Proton VPN: I like to browse with this on. I’ve noticed some places will lock you out if you’re on a VPN, which is silly to me. 1blocker: Uses Safari’s built-in content blockers that fire before the page even loads. It made things move so much faster and smoother for me. Like the VPN, some places get fussy when you have blocking on. Ivory for Mastodon: ever since leaving Twitter I’ve looked for a good community. I found it on Mastodon. And while the built-in web app is nice, Tapbots (who made the excellent Tweetbot) created an app that’s fun, has good integrations, and great filtering. They also support regex filtering, so you can have a lot of fun filtering out noise. iA Writer: I feel very focused when writing here. Notion: it’s how I organize my life. Co-star: I’m a fan of insight systems, and this app has thrown out some incredibly uncomfortable specific information about my life. The Pattern: Similar to Co-star, this app has a nice mapping to your astrological chart. It’s got helpful explainers about upcoming transits. Kind of like a personal astrologer. Cloud Software # Vultr: cloud hosting provider. Nextcloud: I’m using this as a replacement for iCloud, because I switch between devices a lot. Fastmail: I didn’t want to run my own mail server, and I didn’t want it to be with a place that mines my data, so I moved to Fastmail. Coffee \u0026amp; Tea # I don’t drink coffee anymore because it made me an anxious mess, so I switched to matcha. I love making drinks for people, so coffee is still a part of my life.\nI was lucky enough to have someone from Kyoto teach me the ceremonial method of making matcha, and it’s a ritual I do every day. Matcha also has a nicer, smoother release than coffee so there’s no icky angsty feeling in me anymore.\nBreville Bambino Plus: I like this because it has a milk steamer and it’s easy enough to clean. Don’t lose all the instructions on cleaning, I had a hard time sorting out the cleaning cycles later. Fellow Grinder: Being able to dial in the grind is important. It’ll vary if I’m doing a pour-over, moka pot, or a shot of espresso. It’s neat looking, quiet. My only wish is that the rubber gasket didn’t stain with coffee bean oil so easily. Fellow Storage: I need a place to store those beautiful beans, and this has a nice airtight seal. Fellow gooseneck kettle: I have tried a lot of kettles in my life. The way the spout on this is constructed is something else, let me tell you. It has virtually no splatter when you pour, even from some distance away from the vessel you’re pouring into. I also like that I can dial in the temperature and it holds, and it lets me use it for so many things in the kitchen. Ceremonial matcha: Naoki Matcha and thought this had the perfect blend of flavors, so it’s my go-to. Sparkling Water Kegerator # I drink a ton of sparkling mineral water. For years, Topo Chico has been my favorite. But I modified a kegerator to make my own mineral water. I’ll document all the kit I bought if someone wants me to. I plan to look into making my own nitro cold brews next.\nArt # I have a small but curated set of tools for making art. I’ve recently fell in love with Glowforge and working in resin. More to come on this.\n"}]
