I had a lot of good responses to a question I put out onÂ LinkedInÂ about advice for product design portfolios so I thought Iâ€™d expound on that here in hopes of helping you get called in for an interview.
While the principles here are applicable to almost all types of design roles, Iâ€™m going to narrow the focus of this to folks who are seeking a product design role.</description>

      <description>Something I deeply believe is that if youâ€™re able to have focused time to work, youâ€™re going to be able to go further, faster, and deeper than those who donâ€™t.
Thatâ€™s been especially true for me in this time of quarantine. When this began, I was hyper-available to people, answering emails and chats much quicker than I would usually. That, paired with the uncertainty of this pandemic made for a huge drag on my focus and craft.</description>

Over the years, animation evolved from a nice-to-have concept to a core feature. Now, the best companies use animation to inform, delight, and reward the people using their products. Letâ€™s talk about how animation helps and how to use it in our work.
Animation Provides Guidance # I think a lot about this quote from Steve Krug inÂ Donâ€™t Make Me Think:
â€œWe donâ€™t read pages. We scan them.</description>

After the untimely (and still kind of sad) demise of Fireworks, I found myself looking for other ways to design apps and websites. I also had the desire to produce something more interactive for when I talk about my work with stakeholders. It turned out that Sketch, when paired with some other neat tools, would be a big part of this workflow.
In this article, Iâ€™ll talk you through why you should prototype and how you can do it with Sketch and prototyping tools such as Flinto and InVision.</description>

ðŸ’¡ I wrote this article in 2014, and my views have evolved since this. Focus is still important, but please do not change every part of your life to be a better designer. Instead, change it to be a more thoughtful and kind human. The design, or whatever you do, will naturally follow. A guide for designers young (and not so young) # As a young designer, I found myself unable to focus on my work.</description>
