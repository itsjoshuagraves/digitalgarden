      <description>I have always liked spooky stuff, even as a kid I would watch tales from the crypt with my aunt (who narced on me for watching beavis and butthead, strangely enough). I’d read Goosebumps, Bruce Coville, and anything on classic monsters I could find at the library. My first big horror book was Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein and I read that in sixth grade.
But a constant fascination for me were skeletons and skulls.</description>
