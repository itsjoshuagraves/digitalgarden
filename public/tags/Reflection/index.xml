Virtual Reality Experience by Mooms from the Noun Project
I recently made my first VR app for a client who commissioned an app to celebrate their 100th anniversary. In it, you walk through a 3D art gallery complete with with audio and imagery to understand their history.
Having primarily designed for mobile over the last few years, this was a fun new medium to explore. The new constraints and considerations were interesting, too.</description>

A feeling came over me in 2009 when GeoCities was shutting down: â€˜I donâ€™t want all those GIFs to somehow disappear! Theyâ€™re magic.â€™ So I made a home for them, and in the span of a few short weeks, AwesomeGIFs was born.
Powered by the humble WordPress, it operated like so many blogs of its time, publishing new GIFs each day. I loved those misfit GIFs so much â€” they turned out to be so much more fun than Iâ€™d ever imagine, and it warmed me to see so many people take to them like they did.</description>

ðŸ’¡ I wrote this article in 2014, and my views have evolved since this. Focus is still important, but please do not change every part of your life to be a better designer. Instead, change it to be a more thoughtful and kind human. The design, or whatever you do, will naturally follow. A guide for designers young (and not so young) # As a young designer, I found myself unable to focus on my work.</description>
