      <description>What got you here won’t take you there. Always be learning and question your assumptions. Especially those that seem foundational. You’re probably already thinking like a leader. It’s all about seeing the bigger picture. Don’t do this if your goal is power or influence. You can have those without the weight of leadership. Too many ppl in management shouldn’t be there. Have a 90-day plan. It can be broad. Think about your principles.</description>
