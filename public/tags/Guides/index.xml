      <description>Success criteria for apps and websites # As of writing, the goal is to follow WCAG 2.1, but falling back to WCAG 2.0 is acceptable. The following success criteria are below. This has been helpfully adapted by Kris Rivenburgh.
WCAG 2.0 AA # Section 1: Alternatives
Alt text (1.1.1): All images and non-text content needs alt text (there are exceptions) Video &amp;amp; Audio alternatives (1.2.1): All video-only and audio-only content has a text transcript.</description>

      <description>Here we get to bring our creation to life. This will require close collaboration with the rest of your team.
This covers # Building Handoff Expected outcomes # A working product A happy client Happy users Building # Make use of components, both in the design tool and web platform (if that&amp;rsquo;s applicable). This will reduce the hassle everyone will go through when updates are needed.
It is critical to use proper HTML tags and semantic markup to ensure the site performs well in search engines and with accessibility devices.</description>

      <description>What does good collaboration look like? Some thoughts:
To Designers # Attend ceremonies with engineers Treat this like a user interview, you&amp;rsquo;re listening for where they may be getting confused Cross pair with Engineering and PM Get into their backlog or development environment how should cross pairing work? when and how often? what does each do? Bring them into your design file Ensure Engineers have validated and modular designs (with users, stakeholders, and Engineers) to build Do what you can to shorten the understanding gap, with examples: Engineering: learn HTML/CSS/JS, learn basic git PM: plan design work with your PM, co-create stories in your backlog Pair with other designers Designers get better at their craft when we learn by doing work with someone else.</description>

      <description>Key points # Generate interface ideas, as many as possible Get on the same page Involve the right people. Consider: Stakeholders Support/frontline staff Engineers Product managers How to do it # Distribute supplies *In person: **Paper and sharpies Sharpies are important, as they force you to be less detailed Remote: have clients use printer paper folded in half vertically and horizontally OR use the template below to have them draw on it Give clients eight, one minute rounds to individually sketch out a part of the interface Make sure they know they don&amp;rsquo;t have to be an artist.</description>

      <description>How we communicate about our work is just as important as the effort that went into making it. Read the following carefully.
General guidance # Show in context # It‚Äôs always best to show something in context, and at the right fidelity. To that end:
Prefer to show something interactive over something static Prefer to show something in context (e.g. if it‚Äôs an app, show it on a phone. A site should be demoed in a browser.</description>

      <description>This segment helps us validate our thinking through testing and exploration. We may repeat things in segment multiple times to ensure we‚Äôre heading in the right direction before we begin building. Alternatively, we may truncate this process should our intuition or client&amp;rsquo;s knowledge help us reach a better solution faster.
This covers # Using the right fidelity and tool for the job Thinking in systems Collaborating with your team Designing for accessibility Presenting effectively Validation and user testing Expected outcomes # Validation on our ideas from users, stakeholders, and our team An inclusive, accessible design A ready-to-build design (or design system) Use the right fidelity and tool for the job # When designing, we need to work at the right fidelity.</description>

      <title>Ethnographic Interview</title>

      <guid>https://joshuamauldin.com/guides/guides-00007/</guid>
      <description>üí° The big idea here is to¬†**stay quiet and listen**¬†to the person. It&#39;s okay to add in clarifying questions (e.g. &#34;could you say more&#34; or &#34;what led you to that?&#34;), but otherwise let them take the lead. Date**:**¬†Try typing /today Name**:**¬†Person&amp;rsquo;s name Department:¬†Department name
Takeways &amp;amp; observations # List learnings and outputs Questions # E.g. could you walk me through your day yesterday? E.g. what part of your job do you find makes you grumpiest?</description>

      <description>Ethnographic interviews help us understand users in their own environment, the problems they face, and how they face them.
The main goal here is to listen and avoid injecting your own bias into the project. Let the person you&amp;rsquo;re interviewing speak much more than yourself.
Once you&amp;rsquo;re done, synthesize your insights and share them out with your client. Some good talking points:

      <description>Guiding Principles # üí° These principles‚Äîand how we apply them‚Äîare a critical part of what sets us apart from everyone else. They are also what influence the tactics we use. **Read these carefully.** Our work is careful # Design is like woodworking. To get the best from your piece of wood, you need to understand its properties: things like knots and grain‚Äôs direction. Likewise, when we understand the problem and the paths available to us, the solutions tend to reveal themselves We are responsible for what we put into the world so we must consider ‚Äúedge cases‚Äù (aka people) We believe that the richest insights come from spending quality time with the problem, isolated from distractions We build psychological safety among our teammates, stakeholders, and users so that we can have hard conversations when necessary We map the ideals set forth in this playbook to reality.</description>

      <description>Key points # Define the map&amp;rsquo;s scope Limit to one persona&amp;rsquo;s journey so that we aren&amp;rsquo;t too generic Define the intended outcome or endpoint in the journey Involve the right people.

These are generally focused on a specific persona, and we&amp;rsquo;re mapping out their journey from start to finish.
Service Blueprints # If you&amp;rsquo;d like to go deeper to see what types of things are necessary to give users the best possible experience, use a service blueprint. These typically cover layers like:</description>

      <guid>https://joshuamauldin.com/guides/guides-00015/</guid>
      <description>This is how to take yours and others‚Äô privacy/safety into account.
Get a VPN to encrypt your browsing and data. I use Private Internet Access, it‚Äôs like $3/mo and covers all my devices Use Signal or other fully end to end encrypted calls, texts, and videos. Do not use regular SMS or phone calls, they can be tracked. FaceTime audio will do if no other option is available. Do not share whereabouts online, don‚Äôt send sensitive info via twitter and Instagram.</description>

      <description>We use this segment to understand the problem, why it exists, and define areas of focus. This includes big-picture brainstorming about the ideal solutions, learning about the people using our product, the stakeholders, and the space we‚Äôre working in. Everyone (designers, product managers, engineers, and stakeholders) is involved in this phase.
While the tactics and tools we&amp;rsquo;ll use vary project by project, we must make sure to cover the following 4 items.</description>

      <description>We observe users in their environment so that we fully understand the problem and the context in which they work.
We want everything we design to be to the direct benefit of everyone involved. There‚Äôs no better way to see how you can help someone than hearing them say it in their own words.
Desired mindset # Stay curious and have a genuine commitment to learning. Increase our understanding of users and challenge our assumptions.</description>
