      <description>Success criteria for apps and websites # As of writing, the goal is to follow WCAG 2.1, but falling back to WCAG 2.0 is acceptable. The following success criteria are below. This has been helpfully adapted by Kris Rivenburgh.
WCAG 2.0 AA # Section 1: Alternatives
Alt text (1.1.1): All images and non-text content needs alt text (there are exceptions) Video &amp;amp; Audio alternatives (1.2.1): All video-only and audio-only content has a text transcript.</description>

      <description>What does good collaboration look like? Some thoughts:
To Designers # Attend ceremonies with engineers Treat this like a user interview, you&amp;rsquo;re listening for where they may be getting confused Cross pair with Engineering and PM Get into their backlog or development environment how should cross pairing work? when and how often? what does each do? Bring them into your design file Ensure Engineers have validated and modular designs (with users, stakeholders, and Engineers) to build Do what you can to shorten the understanding gap, with examples: Engineering: learn HTML/CSS/JS, learn basic git PM: plan design work with your PM, co-create stories in your backlog Pair with other designers Designers get better at their craft when we learn by doing work with someone else.</description>

Consider: Stakeholders Support/frontline staff Engineers Product managers How to do it # Distribute supplies *In person: **Paper and sharpies Sharpies are important, as they force you to be less detailed Remote: have clients use printer paper folded in half vertically and horizontally OR use the template below to have them draw on it Give clients eight, one minute rounds to individually sketch out a part of the interface Make sure they know they don&amp;rsquo;t have to be an artist.</description>

      <description>How we communicate about our work is just as important as the effort that went into making it. Read the following carefully.
General guidance # Show in context # Itâ€™s always best to show something in context, and at the right fidelity. To that end:
Prefer to show something interactive over something static Prefer to show something in context (e.g. if itâ€™s an app, show it on a phone. A site should be demoed in a browser.</description>

      <description>ðŸ’¡ The big idea here is toÂ **stay quiet and listen**Â to the person. It&#39;s okay to add in clarifying questions (e.g. &#34;could you say more&#34; or &#34;what led you to that?&#34;), but otherwise let them take the lead.

      <description>Ethnographic interviews help us understand users in their own environment, the problems they face, and how they face them.
The main goal here is to listen and avoid injecting your own bias into the project. Let the person you&amp;rsquo;re interviewing speak much more than yourself.
Once you&amp;rsquo;re done, synthesize your insights and share them out with your client. Some good talking points:

      <description>We observe users in their environment so that we fully understand the problem and the context in which they work.
We want everything we design to be to the direct benefit of everyone involved. Thereâ€™s no better way to see how you can help someone than hearing them say it in their own words.
Desired mindset # Stay curious and have a genuine commitment to learning. Increase our understanding of users and challenge our assumptions.</description>
