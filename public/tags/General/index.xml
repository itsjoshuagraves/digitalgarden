I‚Äôve had this feeling that the amount of brainspace that social media occupied was out of balance for me.
I found myself in a problematic situation more often that I‚Äôd like: checking social media during every bit of downtime, or when I was trying to solve a particularly difficult design problem. It made getting things done and being present harder than it should. I needed to be more focused.</description>

üí° I wrote this article in 2015. While I like that I was curious, I want to be clear in that I absolutely do not recommend this kind of stuff. Also, it‚Äôs fun to note that everything from this era is basically a clickbait style headline. Ugh. I‚Äôm always curious about how changing a habit will affect me and have little aversion to change. My main apps for email, search, and anything else get regularly switched, and so do my mobile OSes.</description>
