We need more good feedback in our world, and I don’t just mean the type of feedback that celebrates your good work. I’m talking about feedback that is actionable, specific, and kind; feedback that does not set us on edge or make us fall into an anxious spiral; feedback that helps us collaborate more effectively. The kind of feedback that is actually really hard to do when working remotely.</description>

Here’s the most helpful thing I’ve ever learned by far about conflict: before you have a conversation with someone, make sure you assume positive intent. Read on to discover a technique you can use to apply that idea — if you’re like me, you’ll find it will resolve most conflict before it starts. And, in a fun plot twist, we’ll also cover how this idea shouldn’t be applied at all times because it can harm underrepresented folks if we aren’t careful.</description>

The Legend of Zelda
I played a lot of video games growing up. It all started with The Legend of Zelda. I had such bad allergies that most of my adventuring had to be more pixel-based than anything. I didn’t expect to learn all that time spent playing video games would amount to anything, especially when it came to conflict resolution. Turns out there’s a lot more in common with old school video games and modern day human behavior than you’d think.</description>
