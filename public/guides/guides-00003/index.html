<p>What does good collaboration look like? Some thoughts:</p>
<h2 id="to-designers">
  To Designers

</h2>
<ul>
<li>Attend ceremonies with engineers
<ul>
<li>Treat this like a user interview, you&rsquo;re listening for where they may be getting confused</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cross pair with Engineering and PM
<ul>
<li>Get into their backlog or development environment
<ul>
<li>how should cross pairing work? when and how often? what does each do?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bring them into your design file</li>
<li>Ensure Engineers have validated and modular designs (with users, stakeholders, and Engineers) to build</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do what you can to shorten the understanding gap, with examples:
<ul>
<li>Engineering: learn HTML/CSS/JS, learn basic git</li>
<li>PM: plan design work with your PM, co-create stories in your backlog</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pair with other designers
<ul>
<li>Designers get better at their craft when we learn by doing work with someone else. Each designer should pair regularly with another Artisan designer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Be proactive and finding ways to drive the project forward</li>
<li>Always have reviews with the ultimate stakeholders and always be the one to present your work.</li>
<li>Meet all your stakeholders within the first week of an engagement</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="to-engineers-from-designers">
  To Engineers, From Designers
  <a class="anchor" href="#to-engineers-from-designers">#</a>
</h2>
<ul>
<li>We pair with you on things that affect the user experience
<ul>
<li>We may have sessions where we knock out little UX or UI bugs</li>
<li>We may collaborate on something like Storybook or SwiftUI</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We see each other as partners, nothing we present to the client will be a surprise to you</li>
<li>We use Figma and that helps shorten handoff time
<ul>
<li>We&rsquo;ll teach you how it works</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ll collaborate with you on naming conventions within design files to map this as closely as possible with the current frontend</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>IPMs are for everyone
<ul>
<li>We do &ldquo;live unblocking&rdquo; and address any blockers on the spot</li>
<li>This can help us bring a 4 point story down to a 2 point</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We want you to come to user interviews and tests so you see first hand what our users experience</li>
<li>There is no world in which we can just export CSS, sorry &lt;/3 (but we will work closely with you on getting it done)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="to-product-managers-from-designers">
  To Product Managers, From Designers
  <a class="anchor" href="#to-product-managers-from-designers">#</a>
</h2>
<ul>
<li>There&rsquo;s a lot of overlap in our roles, so we should form a tight partnership</li>
<li>We both gather intelligence from users and stakeholders in partnership
<ul>
<li>We take time each week to do this</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We collaborate with you on artifacts (e.g. opportunity solution trees, risk assessment personas, user journey map, interviews)</li>
<li>We write stories together in the backlog that have an impact on the user experience</li>
<li>We collaborate on the design roadmap and high-level prioritization</li>
<li>We work on the requirements that you define with us and the client</li>
<li>We both advocate for the user an make sure that the right design is actually going to get built and no MVP is too lean</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re meeting stakeholders, we should be there too</li>
<li>We collaborate on the weekly snapshot and any other deliverable that goes to the client
<ul>
<li>A high quality deliverable makes everyone look good and builds trust</li>
</ul>
</li>
