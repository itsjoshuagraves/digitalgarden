## Consulting

I help my clients build new capabilities, products, and teams. I also help them do it in a way that’s unique to their culture, not just giving them a process to follow and taking their money.

If you’d like to work together, visit [my portfolio](https://personal-site-95b339.webflow.io) to see some recent examples of my work.

## Coaching

I created a coaching company in 2022 because I really wanted to focus on putting more kindness and thoughtfulness into the leadership process. The key idea being that leadership’s future is human-centered. The link below will tell you more.
