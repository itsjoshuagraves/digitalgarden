## Consulting

I help my clients build new capabilities, products, and teams. I also help them do it in a way that’s tailored specifically to them, their business, and culture—I don't just give them a process to follow and take their money.

I have over 15 years of experience and 5 of leading teams as a player-coach in healthcare, retail, and other industries. My multidisciplinary approach and experience with design, code, and management allows me to work closely with engineers, product managers, and stakeholders alike to know what they need for success.

You can learn more about [my process](/process) and the [philosophy](/philosophy) that underpins it, too.

## Coaching
![Nice Weather: Developing Human-Centered Leaders](nice-weather.png)

I created a coaching company, Nice Weather, in 2022 because I saw a need for a different kind of leadership: one with a focus on adding more kindness and thoughtfulness into leaders. The key idea being that leadership’s future is human-centered. The link below will tell you more.

## Professional Biography

{{< columns >}}
I’m not like other design leaders.

My ideal day isn’t sitting in strategy meetings all day, managing managers. Instead, I find joy in working at both the strategic tactical level. Some call it a player-coach, I call it my happy place.

Since starting my career, I've built high-performing, deeply collaborative design teams from scratch and designed 5-star mobile apps. Being a leader who loves being hands-on and practicing my craft gives me my edge.

I work with companies in healthcare, fintech, and other consumer-facing industries. My most rewarding projects are those which help people lead better lives through improving their mental and physical health.

I’ve managed directly for over 5 years of management and have over 15 years experience in practicing design. My start came from being a visual artist that created websites for bands.

My values are important, and they’ll enrich both your product and company:

- Being responsible for what we put into the world
- Being principle-driven, not process-shackled
- Kindness, fairness, and equity
- Talking it out
