## Consulting

I help my clients build new capabilities, products, and teams through my company [Lost Horse](https://losthorse.design). I help them do it in a way that’s tailored specifically to them, their business, and culture—it isn’t enough to give them a process to follow and take their money.

Before stepping into being the founder of Lost Horse, I earned 15 years of experience leading teams as a player-coach in healthcare, retail, and other industries. My multidisciplinary approach and experience with design, code, and management allowed me to work closely with engineers, product managers, and stakeholders alike to know what they need for success.

You can learn more about [my process](/process) and the [philosophy](/philosophy) that underpins it, too.

## Professional Biography

I’m the founder of [Lost Horse](https://losthorse.design) and a design leader with over 15 years of experience helping companies create thoughtful, award-winning designs for iOS, Android, and the web. I’ve worked with Fortune 50 companies and small businesses alike, always focusing on human-centered design that drives real results. 

I’m deeply invested about helping smaller businesses scale with the same level of expertise used by larger companies, providing tailored, high-impact design systems and product experiences.

Earlier in my career, I launched AwesomeGIFs, a platform that helped shape communication in the digital age, and whose images are still in use all over the world.
