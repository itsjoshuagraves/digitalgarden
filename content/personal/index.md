Creations
: ## [Visual Art](art)
	Mixed media collages, glitch art and skulls (not real ones!). Lots of darker themes exploring identity, loneliness, memento moris. Also, tinkering.
: ## [Tinkering](tinkering)
	I like to take things apart and put them back together again. Sometimes I get lucky and something cooler comes out the other end.

Writing & Readings
: ## [Journal](journal)
	A place where collect thoughts on topics that matter to me. (I'm intentionally not calling this a blog, as that comes with expectations of constant updates.)
: ## [Read & Watch List](media)
	I watch and read a lot. Here’s some of it.
