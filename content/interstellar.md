Add a little cosmic action to your next design project with these 10 hand-made spray paint textures.

They're huge, grayscale webps that you can drop into any project, mask, and color in no time. This also includes smaller versions of these should you need a smaller file.

Whether you want to add an ethereal feel to your project or some grit, these textures can handle both.

Lastly, this pack includes some layered examples to get you started.

I hope you have as much fun using them as I did making them.
