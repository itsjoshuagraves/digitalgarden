## Hi there.
I'm Joshua. Iâ€˜m working to put more humanity and kindness into the world through my design work and writing. I love spooky stuff, animals of all kinds, and exploring the interconnectedness we all share.

Here you'll find a wiki of my [professional](/professional) and [personal](/personal) life. This site is expansive and is also known as a [digital garden](/about/digital-gardening/). 

Enjoy your time here!

## What's new?
On `September 24, 2023` I made some updates to my [design philosophy](/philosophy).

On `September 10, 2023` I launched a new project, [The Nevermore](https://nevermore.rip). It's dedicated to the works of Edgar Allan Poe and is focused on giving readers a beautiful experience while reading. Hope you'll enjoy!


On `August 31, 2023` I posted a guide in Tinkering about how I [modified a kegerator](/tinkering/sparkling-water/) to make sparkling mineral water.

As of `August 17, 2023` I've added a [bookshelf](/docs/guides/bookshelf) which contains recommendations for newcomers to design.

As of `August 4, 2023`, my forthcoming book, [We Need to Talk](/we-need-to-talk), is officially in editing mode!
