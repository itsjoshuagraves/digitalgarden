# Hi, it's Joshua. 

I'm a player-coach designer who puts humans first. I'm also writing a book on having hard conversations at work. Great to meet you. 

## What is this?

This is a wiki of sorts that catalogs my professional and personal life. It's broken down into spheres, and there's some natural overlap between what's work and what's not. 

This space, just like a garden, is constantly being cultivated and tended. You are seeing an extremely early, very ugly work in progress. That's intended. 

As it grows, you'll see more of the work you've come to expect from me. 

## Where's your work?
If you'd like to see that right now, head over to [my portfolio](https://personal-site-95b339.webflow.io). I'll have it ported over soon.

## Why do this? 

I don't want to limit myself to just "Joshua is a designer." We are all multifaceted and I believe embracing this in ourselves and others is the key to richer, more rewarding lives and relationships.

When we constrain ourselves to just one aspect or role, everyone suffers. It's like [Procrustes' bed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrustes)—in contorting or stretching to fit an arbitrary space or role, we do great harm. This garden is an attempt to reclaim the fullness of my online identity. Some aspects of me will be stronger depending on what need arises. 

We also tend to throw things away and live a permanent state of _now now now_, and I don’t see that being good for anyone in the long term. So this also acts as an archive of sorts. The design of this is intended to be lower tech with the idea of allowing you to meander through and discover (what I hope are) wondrous things.
