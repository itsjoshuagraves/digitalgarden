## What is this?

This is a digital garden. It's a wiki that catalogs my [professional](/professional) and [personal](/personal) life. 

It's broken down into spheres, and there's some natural overlap between what's work and what's not. This site, just like a garden, is constantly being tended. You are seeing an extremely early, very ugly work in progress. That's intended. 

## Where's your work?
[Right this way](/portfolio), please.

## Why do this? 

I don't want to limit myself to just "Joshua is a designer." We are all multifaceted and I believe embracing this in ourselves and others is the key to richer, more rewarding lives and relationships.

### Embracing our full selves

When we constrain ourselves to highlight only one thing about us, everyone suffers. 

It's like [Procrustes' bed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrustes)—in contorting or stretching to fit an arbitrary space or role, we do great harm. This garden is an attempt to reclaim the fullness of my online identity. Some aspects of me will be stronger depending on what need arises.  

### Thinking longer term

We also tend to throw things away and live a permanent state of ___now now now___. I don’t see that being good for anyone in the long term. So this also acts as an archive of sorts. The design of this is intended to be lower tech with the idea of allowing you to meander through and discover (what I hope are) wondrous things.
