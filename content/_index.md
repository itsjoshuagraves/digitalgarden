## What is this?

This site is a wiki that catalogs my [professional](/professional) and [personal](/personal) life. 

This kind of site is also known as a digital garden. Mine has two spheres with some overlap between each. And just like a garden, this site is constantly being tended. [Read more about why I did this.](/about)

## What's new?
On `August 31, 2023` I posted a guide in Tinkering about how I [modified a kegerator](/tinkering/sparkling-water/) to make sparkling mineral water.

As of `August 17, 2023` I've added a [bookshelf](/docs/guides/bookshelf) which contains recommendations for newcomers to design.

As of `August 4, 2023`, my forthcoming book, [We Need to Talk](/we-need-to-talk), is officially in editing mode!

On `July 28, 2023`, I launched a new version of this site with an entirely different vision. So excited. :)
