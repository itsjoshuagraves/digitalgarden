## What is this?

This is a wiki of sorts that catalogs my professional and personal life. It's constantly being cultivated and tended.

## Why do this? 

We are multifaceted and I believe embracing this in ourselves and others is the key to richer lives and relationships. It also makes work easier. 

We also tend to throw things away and live a permanent state of now now now, and I donâ€™t see that being good for anyone in the long term. 

So what you see here catalogs, archives, and allows you to meander through these digital stacks and discover what I hope are wondrous things.
