## What is this?

This is a wiki of sorts that catalogs my professional and personal life. It's constantly being cultivated and tended. You are seeing an extremely early, very ugly work in progress. That's intended. 

As it grows, you'll see more of the work you've come to expect from me. 

## Where's your work?
If you'd like to see that right now, head over to [Webflow](https://personal-site-95b339.webflow.io).

## Why do this? 

We are multifaceted and I believe embracing this in ourselves and others is the key to richer lives and relationships. It also makes work easier. 

We also tend to throw things away and live a permanent state of now now now, and I donâ€™t see that being good for anyone in the long term. 

So what you see here catalogs, archives, and allows you to meander through these digital stacks and discover what I hope are wondrous things.
