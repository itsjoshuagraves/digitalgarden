# Guiding Principles

<aside>
üí° These principles‚Äîand how we apply them‚Äîare a critical part of what sets us apart from everyone else. They are also what influence the tactics we use. **Read these carefully.**

</aside>

# Our work is careful

- Design is like woodworking. To get the best from your piece of wood, you need to understand its properties: things like knots and grain‚Äôs direction.
    - Likewise, when we understand the problem and the paths available to us, the solutions tend to reveal themselves
- We are responsible for what we put into the world so we must consider ‚Äúedge cases‚Äù (aka people)
- We believe that the richest insights come from spending quality time with the problem, isolated from distractions
- We build psychological safety among our teammates, stakeholders, and users so that we can have hard conversations when necessary
- We map the ideals set forth in this playbook to reality. We won't always be able to do 100% of what we believe in, but we can at least help our client adopt a few helpful practices

# Our work happens in short, repeatable cycles

- We do not spend unnecessary time on preparation, we have a ruthless bias toward action and [Start Strong](https://slite.com/api/public/notes/FpN789jGq/redirect)
- We prioritize delivering small bits of information quickly rather than one big thing slowly
- We validate our ideas constantly with users and the business
- We believe it‚Äôs more valuable to have something working than something perfect
- We have strong, smart defaults but are not beholden to any framework, we will adapt our process to fit the need

# Our work is mindful

- We maintain a beginner's mind and actively suspend our assumptions. In this way, we are fully present and unbiased when trying to understand a problem
- We value gentleness and intuition over rigor and process
- We welcome criticism and differing viewpoints
- We stay objective‚Ä¶mostly. Data and goals are important, but incomplete without intuition
- We create products with a soul

# Our work represents the users

- We are the voice of the users and help our stakeholders map their needs to users‚Äô expectations
- We owe clients more than our labor‚Äîwe also owe them our counsel and will not shy away from hard conversations on the implications of their decisions
- We practice compassionate detachment, which allows us to advocate for what's right and then let the client make the final call

# Our work is collaborative

- We strongly prefer tools that encourage collaboration (Figma, Miro, etc.)
- We work as a team with other disciplines, Design does not rule everything
- We cross pair with each other, even across disciplines

# Our work lifts the community up

- We participate in the design community by writing, speaking, mentoring, and coaching others
