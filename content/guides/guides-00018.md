We observe users in their environment so that we fully understand the problem and the context in which they work.

We want everything we design to be to the direct benefit of everyone involved. There’s no better way to see how you can help someone than hearing them say it in their own words.

# Desired mindset

Stay curious and have a genuine commitment to learning. Increase our understanding of users and challenge our assumptions.

- Guess less and work from a position of being informed and confident.
- Does not have to be cumbersome, expensive or take up a lot of time. Minimal Viable Ethnography can be accomplished in 3 days!
- Research can be easy, we can fold into any workflow; sprints, agile or lean.
- Most likely there is already data on hand that we just need to bring to the surface!
- Rather than making assumptions about users, we want to learn from them.
- By guessing less we can reduce the potential for wasted time and resources.
- Does not have to feel stale, monolithic or like an academic exercise.

# Interviews

Above all, be genuine, engaged and positive**. **Listen significantly more than you speak. While conducting an interview (user or stakeholder)  it’s important to be genuinely interested and non-judgmental. People will notice this and be more willing to reveal themselves, particularly their anxieties, prejudices and insecurities.

# Removing bias

We are burdened with biases and it is tough to sense one’s own. We can combat this by referring to an external standard and work to check each other in an environment that fosters psychological safety and mutual respect. Having a knowledge of common biases also helps to recognize when they appear.

Focus on asking open-ended questions, which invite conversation and insight. For example:

- What led you to that?
- Could you say more?
- How are you seeing it?
- What’s missing?

We intentionally avoid leading questions as well as questions which elicit simple responses such as yes or no.
