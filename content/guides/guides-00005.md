How we communicate about our work is just as important as the effort that went into making it. Read the following carefully.

# General guidance

## Show in context

It’s always best to show something in context, and at the right fidelity. To that end:

- Prefer to show something interactive over something static
- Prefer to show something in context (e.g. if it’s an app, show it on a phone. A site should be demoed in a browser.)
- Avoid sending any static PDF or mockup, especially by email
    - If this is our only option, it’s important to make sure we accompany it with a verbal conversation at the same time so the design isn’t misinterpreted

## Scope your sessions

Just like we don’t start projects without clear goals, we don’t have design presentations without expected outcomes and structure.

- Be specific in articulating what you need feedback on
- Give ample time
- general
    - always show in context
        - apps should be on phones or shown in mockups of phones
        - sites should be in live html
        - only send pdfs and static imagery as a last resort
    - scope the session
        - what specifically would you like feedback on
            - do not ask them if they like it
            - e.g. what might we not be seeing, what hurdles do you see in adoption?
        - give ample time for feedback
            - consider sending in advance so feedback can be more considered
            - present work, give them 5 or so min to write feedback down
        - do/try/consider
- for products
    - make it about goals
- for branding/marketing
    - focus on brand guidelines, tone and voice
