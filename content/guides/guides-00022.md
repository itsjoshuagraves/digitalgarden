# User Test

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Before we test anything, we generate hypotheses. It can be as simple as "people can successfully sign up" or as complex as "people will understand that [this button] will alter their search results."

</aside>

# Hypothesis

- We hope to:Â e.g. desired learning
- So that:Â e.g. users can reduce time with support
- We'll know we're right when:Â e.g. users call in less frequently to the call center

## Overview

Hi, my name isÂ name. I work withÂ company. I am doing some research to improve our work by better understanding real people like you. This should take no more thanÂ 15 minutes.

Do you mind if we record this call for notetaking purposes only? The recording will not be published or shared outside our team.

As you go along, Iâ€™m going to ask you to try toÂ **think out loud**Â as much as possible:Â **describe what youâ€™re looking at, what youâ€™re trying to do/accomplish, and what youâ€™re thinking**. This will be a big help to us.

Also, please be asÂ **honest and unfilteredÂ **as possible. Donâ€™t worry that youâ€™re going to hurt our feelings; weâ€™re doing this to improve our customersâ€™ experience, so we need to hear your honest reactions.

If you need to take a break at any point, just let me know.

> Optional: NDA
We have a non-disclosure agreement that states you will not discuss what weâ€™re showing you today, any ideas or opinions, or anything shared during the time we are together with anyone outside of the session. Would you be willing to sign this? Please take all the time you need to review it.*[Hand over paper copy. Get signature.]*Optional: Recording Permission
With your permission, weâ€™d like to record this conversation. This will only be used to transcribe what you said and wonâ€™t be seen by anyone outside of our project.

## Pre-test Interview

!! These are questions designed to build rapport. This is also a good spot to fit in any questions that give greater context to you or the team about the users' behavior.

Before we get to the fun part, I have a few quick questions for you:

- e.g. what sites or apps do you find yourself using?
- e.g. after work, how much time would you say you spend on screens?

## The Scenario

!! Lay out the scenario for them, give them clear, attainable goals and don't lead them. You can write a complex scenario below or you can keep it to just a few bullet points. The main goal here isÂ **consistency**.

Here's the scenario:

- Goal 1: e.g. we want to see if you're able to sign up for an account.
- Goal 2: e.g. can you add a new payment method to your account?

## Post-test follow up

!! If you've offered an incentive to do this interview, get their email or mailing address so that you can send it out. Tell them when they can expect it.

That is all we need from you today. Thank you so much for giving us some time and attention!
