# Building

Make use of components, both in the design tool and web platform (if that's applicable). This will reduce the hassle everyone will go through when updates are needed.

It is critical to use proper HTML tags and semantic markup to ensure the site performs well in search engines and with accessibility devices.

# Handoff

Depending on the skill of your engineer, you might need to pair with an engineer to work on the markup together.

Ensure engineers have ready access to your designs. The preference is to let them into your design tool, but if that's not an option ensure you use something like InVision's Inspect or Zeplin, or Avocode. This allows them to directly export the things they need, as well as the position/size/color of every element.

Try to use good naming conventions. Consider mimicking the names engineers use to implement what you design. A common naming convention is BEM (block, element, modifier).

If you're building an app, you should keep a close eye on the betas you receive. The earlier you can give feedback, the better. It's much more costly to change things the closer you get to completion.
