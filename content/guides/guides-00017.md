We use this segment to understand the problem, why it exists, and define areas of focus. This includes big-picture brainstorming about the ideal solutions, learning about the people using our product, the stakeholders, and the space we’re working in. Everyone (designers, product managers, engineers, and stakeholders) is involved in this phase.

While the tactics and tools we'll use vary project by project, **we must make sure to cover the following 4 items.**

## This covers

1. Who are we helping?
2. Who are we working with?
3. Why are we facing this problem?
4. What constraints do we have?

Alternatively, your team may opt for other traditional design activities like Design Sprints, which contain some of these tactics and tools.

## Expected outcomes

- First and foremost: a tight collaboration and partnership with the other crafts
- A shared understanding of the business, stakeholders, and our goals
- Reduced product risk by outlining a validated product strategy of prioritized features based on evidence from target users
- Definition of MVP
- Validated target users, along with a deep understanding and strong empathy for them
- Two weeks of task for developers to start building
- A low fidelity UX framework of wireframes, and core use scenarios

# Who are we helping?

We have several tools for understanding the people who use this product. Try not to call everyone "users," refer to them as "customers," "buyers," or just "people."

It's important to think holistically so we know how what we're building fits into the entire experience, so we may also need to consider the client's mission, vision, and/or users' journeys.

It’s important to practice mindfulness here. All the tactics below are designed to help you understand by listening. We do this so we don’t project our own biases or work off of our own assumptions.

The heart of what we do is to serve the user in the best possible way. To faciliate that, we research. We recommend starting with User Research Plans to define your goals. More below.

### Tactics

1. User Research Plan
2. User Interviews & Tests
3. Ethnographic Interviews
4. Journey Maps & Service Blueprints
5. Mission/vision setting
6. Discovery & Framing

# Who are we working with?

It's important to know who has a say in the product. We need to identify all stakeholders early on so that we can avoid last-minute hiccups and mishaps because we didn't take a stakeholder's feedback and needs into account.

### Tactics

- Stakeholder Interviews
- Stakeholder Map

# Why are we facing this problem?

Before we can address the problem, we want to understand how it came to be one. To do that, we listen.

Ask open-ended questions to stakeholders about the problem, then see where everyone's views line up and diverge.

We don't need to do a weeks-long discovery process to tell a client what they already know. That's a surefire way to wreck trust, waste time, and waste money. Clients, like users, are great at identifying their problems and pain points as they live with the problem every day. We still want to probe deeper and see if there's anything underlying.

### Tactics

- Journey Maps & Service Blueprints
- Stakeholder Interviews
- User Interviews & Tests
- Ethnographic Interviews
# What constraints do we have?

We can create the most beautiful, elegant interface anyone's ever seen; however, if we aren't mindful of the constraints our design will fail.

Typical types of constraints include:

- Timeline
- Technical limitations (e.g. React Native, Xamarin Forms, or similar)
- Platforms (e.g. mobile vs desktop, iOS or Android)
- Software (e.g. Figma or XD)
