# About

{{< figure src="/img/DSC00162.jpeg" title="Basquiat" >}}

## This wiki is the wellspring of my digital life and a catalog of my analog one.

Based on the digital garden idea, inspired by [Helvetica Blanc](https://helveticablanc.com)
The following is adapted from [https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/home.html](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/home.html)

It is built to adapt to my needs as they change, and to [technology as it evolves](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/lasting.html). The databases are in human-readable plaintext formats. There is no JavaScript, trackers, or complicated nonsense. 

Using this tool should be **calming**, its formats and subsequent products versionable, re-purposable, interpretable and text-editable. Only through **open sources, open standards, human-readable formats** and their independencies, might they survive this fleeting age of self-destructing informatics. These attributes should not only be perceptible in its design, but deeply rooted in its code.

This type of website is a often referred to as a "memex", a kind of archive and mirror of everything that one has done, that one has learnt. It's a living document that outlines where one has been, and a tool that advises where one could go.
