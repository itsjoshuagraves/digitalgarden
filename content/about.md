## How's this built?
I use Hugo, a static site generator. It's working with Go, markdown, and powered by GitHub pages. There's no fancy CMS, no loads of animations. 

In the future, I'll be focusing on making it even easier and greener to load, adding image dithering and hopefully attempting to most entirely to green, solar-powered hosting.

## What's the idea?

This site is inspired by the concept of [digital gardening](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/). [Helvetica Blanc](https://helveticablanc.com) got me interested in the idea after feeling some tension related to what a site should be.

I also took inspiration from [Devine Lu Linvega](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/home.html), who says the following about sites such as this:

> This type of website is a often referred to as a "memex", a kind of archive and mirror of everything that one has done, that one has learnt. It's a living document that outlines where one has been, and a tool that advises where one could go.
