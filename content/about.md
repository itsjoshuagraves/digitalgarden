## Professional Biography
{{< columns >}}
I’m not like other design leaders.

My ideal day isn’t sitting in strategy meetings all day, managing managers. Instead, I find joy in working at both the strategic tactical level. Some call it a player-coach, I call it my happy place.

Since starting my career, I've built high-performing, deeply collaborative design teams from scratch and designed 5-star mobile apps. Being a leader who loves being hands-on and practicing my craft gives me my edge.

I work with companies in healthcare, fintech, and other consumer-facing industries. My most rewarding projects are those which help people lead better lives through improving their mental and physical health.

I’ve managed directly for over 5 years of management and have over 15 years experience in practicing design. My start came from being a visual artist that created websites for bands.

My values are important, and they’ll enrich both your product and company:

- Being responsible for what we put into the world
- Being principle-driven, not process-shackled
- Kindness, fairness, and equity
- Talking it out

I'm currently writing a book called [“We Need to Talk: How to Have Hard Conversations with Anyone”](https://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/we-need-to-talk-a-survival-guide-for-tough-conversations/) for Rosenfeld Media. It’s due out in 2023.

Talk to me if you want to discuss:

- Getting away from a stale, process-driven culture into a thoughtful, human-centered one
- Taking a concept to validated idea in (next to) no time
- How to be the best, most supportive leader you can to your team
- How to get people to care about accessibility
- Exactly how annoyed to get when a designer detaches a component in Figma

## Personal Biography

I'm ever curious. Always looking for connections, always trying something new. 

In my spare time, I tinker with restoring old iPods and making art with skulls (not real ones, which would be weird). I absolutely adore typography and have designed multiple typefaces, including [Cosmata](/cosmata) and Uptown Sans. I [read a lot](/media).

I live in Los Angeles.
