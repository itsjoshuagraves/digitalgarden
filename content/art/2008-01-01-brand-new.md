{{< hint info >}}
This band was my first paying music client and had a significant impact on my visual development. But the singer was accused of [sexual misconduct with a minor](https://uproxx.com/music/brand-new-jesse-lacey-sexual-misconduct-allegations/) which later dissolved the band. The sheer irony of the title never ceases to amaze me in light of said information.
