I wanted to restore older iPods because I love their focus and simplicity. It had everything I needed, plus Solitaire. I rebuilt old iPod minis, giving them new paint jobs that never existed in the wild. 

I also swapped out physical hard drives for flash drives. It gave them a nearly infinite battery and storage space. One has 512GB, more than my first 3 iPods combined.
