The most effective process is one that's resilient and adaptable. That means being principle-driven and not process-driven. Here’s why: each project, problem, and team are unique. Each person’s insight and experience are, too. Following principles instead of a rigorous process lets us honor that uniqueness to deliver truly wonderful results. Not only that, we can move quickly and with intention to deliver great software. You can read [how it looks in practice](/process), too.

## 1. Design is careful

- Design is like woodworking. To get the best from a piece of wood, you need to understand its properties: its knots, grain direction, and how far it will bend before it breaks. It will tell you what it wants to be If you listen.
- Consider the edge cases and unintended harm a product may create when making it, lest it end up in a dystopian Black Mirror episode.
- The richest insights come from spending quality time with the problem, isolated from distractions.
- Prize and prioritize deep, focused work time.

## 2. Design happens in short, repeatable cycles

- Set strong, smart defaults but do not be beholden to any framework. Adapt the process to fit the need.
- Do not spend unnecessary time on preparation, ave a ruthless bias toward action and start strong.
- Prioritize delivering small bits of information quickly rather than one big thing slowly.
- It’s more valuable to have something working than something perfect.

## 3. Design is mindful

- Maintain a beginner's mind and actively suspend assumptions. In this way, it is possible to be fully present and unbiased when trying to understand a problem.
- Value gentleness and intuition over rigor and process.
- Stay objective…mostly. Data and goals are important, but are incomplete without intuition.
- Practice compassionate detachment, which allows one to advocate for what's right and then let the client make the final call.

## 4. Design represents the users

- Designers are the voice of the users and help our stakeholders map their needs to users’ expectations.
- Validate ideas constantly with users and the business.
- Designers owe clients more than their labor—they also owe clients their counsel. Do not shy away from hard conversations on the implications of a decision.

## 5. Design is collaborative

- Strongly prefer tools that encourage collaboration (Figma, Miro, etc.).
- Work as a team with other disciplines, Design does not rule everything.
- Pair up with each other, even (and especially) across disciplines.
- Feedback is a gift. Welcome criticism and differing viewpoints.
