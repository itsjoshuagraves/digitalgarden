## Personal Biography

I'm ever curious. Always looking for connections, always trying something new. 

In my spare time, I tinker with restoring old iPods and making art with skulls (not real ones, which would be weird). I absolutely adore typography and have designed multiple typefaces, including [Cosmata](/cosmata) and Uptown Sans. I [read a lot](/media).

I call Joshua Tree home, but split time between there and Los Angeles.

## Professional Biography
{{< columns >}}
I’m not like other design leaders.

My ideal day isn’t spent sitting in strategy meetings, managing managers. Instead, I thrive at both the strategic and tactical levels. There's joy for me in getting my hands dirty and leading teams while practicing my craft.

Since the start of my career, I’ve built high-performing, deeply collaborative design teams from scratch, and I’ve designed 5-star mobile apps that people love. My focus has been on healthcare, fintech, and other consumer-facing industries, but the most rewarding projects are those that help people improve their mental and physical health.

With over 15 years of design experience and 5+ years in direct leadership, I’ve learned what it takes to guide teams and help companies grow. My journey started as a visual artist creating websites for bands, and it’s evolved into something far more impactful.

I believe in being responsible for what we put into the world, and I bring that principle into every project. My values—kindness, fairness, equity, and being principle-driven, not process-shackled—are more than words; they shape how I approach design, leadership, and the relationships I build with clients. I believe in talking things out, even when the conversation is hard, because that’s how we grow and create the best outcomes together.
