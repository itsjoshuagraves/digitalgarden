I'm ever curious. Always looking for connections, always trying something new. In my spare time, I tinker with restoring old iPods and making art. I absolutely adore typography and have designed multiple typefaces, including [Cosmata](/cosmata) and Uptown Sans. I [read a lot](/media).

I call Joshua Tree home, but split time between there and Los Angeles.

## Professional Biography
Recently, I founded [Lost Horse](https://losthorse.design) and a design leader with over 15 years of experience helping companies create thoughtful, award-winning designs for iOS, Android, and the web. I’ve worked with Fortune 50 companies and small businesses alike, always focusing on human-centered design that drives real results. 

I’m deeply invested about helping smaller businesses scale with the same level of expertise used by larger companies, providing tailored, high-impact design systems and product experiences.

Earlier in my career, I launched AwesomeGIFs, a platform that helped shape communication in the digital age, and whose images are still in use all over the world.

I’m also the author of the forthcoming book [We Need to Talk: How to Have Hard Conversations with Anyone](/we-need-to-talk), which offers insights into building trust and communication in any situation. It releases April 15, 2025.
