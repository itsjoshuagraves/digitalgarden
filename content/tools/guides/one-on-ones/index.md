## Structure
Each meeting will last about 30 minutes and will be handled weekly (or at least bi-weekly). 

This should not be a status update. Nor should you tell someone "this is your time" and not add structure to it.

## We’ll cover three topics:

1.	Updates from them
2.	Updates from me
3.	Coaching conversation about what they're doing well and what can be improved
---

## Sample questions
These questions are geared towards seeing how we can best get alignment with the company's goals and their interests. 

1. What’s been going well? Any wins from last week? What would you want to have handled differently?
2. How am I doing? Would you like more or less direction?
3. Ask occasionally so you don’t become a micromanager or a detached leader.
4. What skills would you like to acquire in the short term?
5. How can we improve team dynamics?
6. What would you do differently or focus on if you were me?

Finally, make sure to keep it human and ask them about life is outside of work. You might learn something cool.
