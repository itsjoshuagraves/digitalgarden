How we communicate about our work is just as important as the effort that went into making it. Read the following carefully.

## Show in context

Itâ€™s always best to show something in context and at the right fidelity. To that end:

- Show interactive over static
- Show it in context
- Never send a PDF, especially by email

To not do these loses valuable context.

## Scope your sessions

Know what you want to get out of your sessions before going in.

- Articulate what you need feedback on: is it a login flow? Legibility check?
    - Discuss how your work maps to objectives and goals.
    - If it's brand-related, focus on brand guidelines, tone and voice.
- Give ample time to consider and discuss.
    - Consider sending in advance so feedback can be more considered
- Do not ask someone if they like it. Do not tell them everything that's on the screen.
    - Instead ask things like "what might we not be seeing," "what hurdles do you see in adoption?
- Give them 5 or so min to write feedback down
    - Initial gut reactions don't always yield the most productive comments.
