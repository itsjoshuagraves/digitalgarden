### Don't Make Me Think, Revisited: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability
This covers basic design principles and how/why to validate your ideas. 

I do have two nits, despite this being so helpful: the goal isn’t to remove _all_ friction, it exists for a reason and you need to manage it. Also, this book assumes you have a system for the ethical implications of your design, as you clearly wouldn’t want to “not make me think” your way into doing something unethical.

### Just Enough Research
Good research is about asking more and better questions, and thinking critically about the answers. Done well, it will save your team time and money by reducing unknowns and creating a solid foundation to build the right thing, in the most effective way.

Learn how to discover your competitive advantages, spot your own blind spots and biases, understand and harness your findings, and why you should never, ever hold a focus group. You’ll start doing good research faster than you can plan your next pitch.

### Continuous Discovery Habits
How do you know that you are making a product or service that your customers want? How do you ensure that you are improving it over time? How do you guarantee that your team is creating value for your customers in a way that creates value for your business?

In this book, you'll learn a structured and sustainable approach to continuous discovery that will help you answer each of these questions, giving you the confidence to act while also preparing you to be wrong. You'll learn to balance action with doubt so that you can get started without being blindsided by what you don't get right.

## The Really Good Stuff
You can’t just read design books. Design is about thinking, observing, and articulating. The best examples of that come from outside sources, as true creativity can’t come from being self-referential.

### Deep Work
On focus and its importance. It's smartly written, and has extremely practical tips. But it's more than just being about productivity. It's about how to realize ideas in a world that has forgotten how to slow down and think.
