### Don't Make Me Think, Revisited
This covers basic design principles and how/why to validate your ideas. 

I do have two nits, despite this being so helpful: the goal isn’t to remove _all_ friction, it exists for a reason and you need to manage it. Also, this book assumes you have a system for the ethical implications of your design, as you clearly wouldn’t want to “not make me think” your way into doing something unethical. By Steve Krug.

### Continuous Discovery Habits
It's a different way of looking at product discovery and planning. Instead of "we want this thing, now go do it" you brainstorm opportunities to serve a goal. It is a welcome inversion of product discovery processes. By Teresa Torres.

## The Really Good Stuff
You can’t _just_ read design books. Good designers are clear thinkers, sharp observers, and can clearly define what a problem is. The best examples of such come from outside sources, as true creativity can’t come from being entirely self-referential.
