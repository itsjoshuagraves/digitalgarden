## Key points

- Define the map's scope
    - Limit to one persona's journey so that we aren't too generic
    - Define the intended outcome or endpoint in the journey
- Involve the right people. Consider:
    - Stakeholders
    - Support/frontline staff
    - Engineers
    - Product managers

## How to do it

- Give participants 10 minutes to individually map out individual steps, then come together with the rest of the team to synthesize
    - Instruct our participants to avoid getting mired in details at this point (e.g. we don't need to include making API calls to servers when registering a user, just talk about registering the user)
- Once you establish a batch of related touchpoints, group them into stages
- Give participants another 10 minutes to individually come up with pain points and ideas for improvement for a particular step, then come together with the rest of the team to synthesize
