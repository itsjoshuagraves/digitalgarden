## Professional
I’ve just finished my book, [We Need to Talk](/we-need-to-talk). It’s off to production and will launch in the first half of 2025. 

I saw an opportunity to launch a company that I’d always wanted to, and I did. It’s called [Lost Horse](/lost-horse). It’s software engineering and design with a focus on sustainability and when I hire enough people, employee ownership. 

## Creative
Lately I’ve been listening to a lot of Lord Huron, Poppy, The National, Uncle Acid, and a host of previously unknown to me artists from the mid century. It’s feeding a writing/art project I’m working on. This also makes me interested in learning music again, and I'm going to investigate that. 

## Personal
There’s also a sitting/meditation practice I’m attempting to build. I’m okay at making time for it, but sometimes I think about sitting and then realize how it's been days. I'll keep at it.

For the last few years I have had a voracious reading habit, but that’s slowed a bit as I’ve been focusing on making physical things and working with my hands, laser engraving, and other media.
