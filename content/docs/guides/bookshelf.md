## The Really Good Stuff
You can’t just read design books. Design is about thinking, observing, and articulating. The best examples of that come from outside sources, as true creativity can’t come from being self-referential. 
### ["On Writing"](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Memoir-Craft-Stephen-King/dp/1982159375)
This teaches you about managing your own time and communicating. By Stephen King.
### ["Deep Work"](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692)
On focus and its importance. It's smartly written, and has extremely practical tips. But it's more than just being about productivity. It's about how to realize ideas in a world that has forgotten how to slow down and think.
