## 101: Fundamentals
1. ["The Non-Designer's Design Book"](https://www.amazon.com/Williams-Non-Designers-Design-Bk_p3-Designers/dp/0321534042) by Robin Williams
	- This covers the basics of visual design and provides practical tips on how to create effective layouts, use color and typography effectively, and more.
2. ["Don't Make Me Think, Revisited: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability”](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/dont-make-me/9780133597271/) by Steve Krug
	- This covers basic design principles and how/why to validate your ideas.
3. ["How to Make Sense of Any Mess"](https://abbycovert.com/make-sense/) by Abby Covert
	- This covers how to approach massively complex problems in a human, easy way.

## 201: Prototyping
1. ["Progressive Web Apps"](https://abookapart.com/products/progressive-web-apps) by Jason Grisby
	- Progressive web apps represent the next big digital opportunity: they look and feel like native apps, they work offline, and they’re available to anyone—no app store required. But with that freedom and flexibility come challenging questions about how to create the most value for your users (and your bottom line). Jason Grigsby answers the what, why, and how of progressive web apps, from making the case in your organization to reaching your users in bold, new ways. Build your audience, increase revenue, and widen the web’s reach—all with the power of progressive web apps.
2. ["Practical Design Discovery"](https://abookapart.com/products/practical-design-discovery) by Tim Brown
	- Design discovery is crucial to a project’s success—unite your team in an approach toward a common goal. Explore the role of discovery in product design, how to use and structure your favorite techniques for success, and how to synthesize and document what you learn. With Dan Brown’s flexible framework for planning and practicing discovery activities, you’ll set every design endeavor on the right path.
3. ["Design is a Job"](https://abookapart.com/products/design-is-a-job) by Mike Montiero
	- The first edition of this book taught you how to sell design, draw up contracts, work with clients, and navigate the business of design. And, yeah, that’s all still (mostly) there. But design has changed, and this book has changed with it. In this second edition, Mike Monteiro not only covers how to be a working designer, but also how to take care of yourself, deal with toxic workplaces, and learn to operate in a community rather than as individual practitioners.

## The Really Good Stuff
You can’t just read design books. Design is about thinking, observing, and articulating. The best examples of that come from outside sources, as true creativity can’t come from being self-referential.
