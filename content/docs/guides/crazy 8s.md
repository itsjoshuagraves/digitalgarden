## Key points

1. Generate interface ideas, as many as possible
2. Get on the same page
3. Involve the right people. Consider:
    1. Stakeholders
    2. Support/frontline staff
    3. Engineers
    4. Product managers

## How to do it

1. Distribute supplies
    1. *In person: **Paper and sharpies
        1. Sharpies are important, as they force you to be less detailed
    2. **Remote:** have clients use printer paper folded in half vertically and horizontally OR use the template below to have them draw on it
2. Give clients eight, one minute rounds to individually sketch out a part of the interface
    1. Make sure they know they don't have to be an artist. It's just about getting your idea out there and discussing it.
3. For the next 30 minutes, allow each person to show their ideas.
    1. After someone presents an idea, ask if anyone had something similar. Group those together.
    2. If you're remote, you can ask them to take a photo and email it or upload it to a shared Miro document.
