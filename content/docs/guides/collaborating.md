summary: "What does good collaboration look like from each discipline's perspective?"

## To Designers

- Attend ceremonies with engineers
    - Treat this like a user interview, you're listening for where they may be getting confused
- Cross pair with Engineering and PM
    - Get into their backlog or development environment
        - how should cross pairing work? when and how often? what does each do?
    - Bring them into your design file
    - Ensure Engineers have validated and modular designs (with users, stakeholders, and Engineers) to build
- Do what you can to shorten the understanding gap, with examples:
    - Engineering: learn HTML/CSS/JS, learn basic git
    - PM: plan design work with your PM, co-create stories in your backlog
- Pair with other designers
    - Designers get better at their craft when we learn by doing work with someone else. Each designer should pair regularly with another Artisan designer.
- Be proactive and finding ways to drive the project forward
- Always have reviews with the ultimate stakeholders and always be the one to present your work.
- Meet all your stakeholders within the first week of an engagement

## To Engineers, From Designers

- We pair with you on things that affect the user experience
    - We may have sessions where we knock out little UX or UI bugs
    - We may collaborate on something like Storybook or SwiftUI
- We see each other as partners, nothing we present to the client will be a surprise to you
- We use Figma and that helps shorten handoff time
    - We'll teach you how it works
    - We'll collaborate with you on naming conventions within design files to map this as closely as possible with the current frontend
- IPMs are for everyone
    - We do "live unblocking" and address any blockers on the spot
    - This can help us bring a 4 point story down to a 2 point
- We want you to come to user interviews and tests so you see first hand what our users experience
- There is no world in which we can just export CSS, sorry </3 (but we will work closely with you on getting it done)

## To Product Managers, From Designers

- There's a lot of overlap in our roles, so we should form a tight partnership
- We both gather intelligence from users and stakeholders in partnership
    - We take time each week to do this
- We collaborate with you on artifacts (e.g. opportunity solution trees, risk assessment personas, user journey map, interviews)
- We write stories together in the backlog that have an impact on the user experience
- We collaborate on the design roadmap and high-level prioritization
- We work on the requirements that you define with us and the client
- We both advocate for the user an make sure that the right design is actually going to get built and no MVP is too lean
- If you're meeting stakeholders, we should be there too
- We collaborate on the weekly snapshot and any other deliverable that goes to the client
    - A high quality deliverable makes everyone look good and builds trust
