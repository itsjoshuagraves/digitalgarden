## Key points

1. Define the map's scope
    1. Limit to one persona's journey so that we aren't too generic
    2. Define the intended outcome or endpoint in the journey
2. Involve the right people. Consider:
    1. Stakeholders
    2. Support/frontline staff
    3. Engineers
    4. Product managers

## How to do it

1. Give clients 10 minutes to individually map out individual steps, then come together with the rest of the team to synthesize
    1. Instruct our clients to avoid getting mired in details at this point (e.g. we don't need to include making API calls to servers when registering a user, just talk about registering the user)
2. Once you establish a batch of related touchpoints, group them into stages
3. Give clients another 10 minutes to individually come up with pain points and ideas for improvement for a particular step, then come together with the rest of the team to synthesize
