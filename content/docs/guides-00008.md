Ethnographic interviews help us understand users in their own environment, the problems they face, and how they face them.

The main goal here is to listen and avoid injecting your own bias into the project. Let the person you're interviewing speak much more than yourself.

Once you're done, synthesize your insights and share them out with your client. Some good talking points:

- What lined up
- What diverged
- What patterns emerged
