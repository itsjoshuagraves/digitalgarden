ðŸ’¡ The big idea here is toÂ **stay quiet and listen**Â to the person. It's okay to add in clarifying questions (e.g. "could you say more" or "what led you to that?"), but otherwise let them take the lead.

## Intro

Hi, my name is your name. I work with company. Our team is doing research to improve our work by better understanding real people like you. This should take no more than e.g. 15 minutes.

Do you mind if we record this call for note taking purposes only? The recording will not be published or shared outside our team.

[Optional 30 seconds chat about weather and/or sports]

## The questions

Now,Â **walk me through your day yesterday**Â in as much detail as possible. Don't worry about boring me, I want to know everything.

Next, tell meÂ **what parts of your job make you grumpiest**.

Okay, finally, tell me:Â **if you could wave a magic wand**, what would you change to make your job easier?

## Wrap-up

That's it from me. Is there anything you would like to add?
