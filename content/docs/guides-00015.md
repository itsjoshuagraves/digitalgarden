This is how to take yours and others’ privacy/safety into account.

1. Get a VPN to encrypt your browsing and data. I use Private Internet Access, it’s like $3/mo and covers all my devices
2. Use Signal or other fully end to end encrypted calls, texts, and videos. **Do not use regular SMS or phone calls, they can be tracked.** FaceTime audio will do if no other option is available.
3. Do not share whereabouts online, don’t send sensitive info via twitter and Instagram. Those companies will turn your info over in a flash.
4. Do not log onto Instagram or Facebook, make sure background access, location, microphone are all disabled. Better yet, delete them from your device. These services are very good at determining your location and will cooperate with law enforcement in sharing that info.
5. Turn on airplane mode and make sure Bluetooth is off before going to protest. Your phone can be tracked by technologies like Wireshark.
6. Disable Face ID or Touch ID. Cops have forced phones to people’s faces or fingers to unlock. It’s illegal but still happens.
7. Use a strong password, not 4 or 6 digit pins. Those can be guessed in 4 minutes to 11 hours.
8. Do not keep sensitive info on your phone in case it’s confiscated. Remember, there isn’t just data on there about you, there’s data on your friends, which could lead to their arrest and/or a threat to their safety.
9. If your phone is confiscated and returned to you, **do not unlock it**. It’s likely been compromised by an app called HideUI, which stores your passcode. Cops engineer scenarios to take your device when you’re being processed, let you have it to get some numbers, then snoop on everything else in your phone.
10. If you back your phone up to the cloud, know that Apple regularly unencrypts and shares this data with law enforcement. They talk big about privacy on your phone but don’t talk about how they will let law enforcement have your data if you use iCloud. Turn on Advanced Data Protection.
