This is a modern take on the classic Beatles shirt, focused on the design process. I originally designed this for BlendConf, a lovely conference in Charlotte (RIP).

Each shirt will be unique, as the gradients have to be made by hand.

This shirt is printed on an ultra-soft, vintage black cotton shirt. There are also neat printing processes at work, notably something called split fountain gradients. This means the colors are going to be bold, beautiful, andâ€¦well, super gradient-ey.
