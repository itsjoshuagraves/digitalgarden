Since beginning my speaking career, I've:

- Talked with web3 engineers at ETHDenver on why they should care about design
- Given a masterclass at Rosenfeld‚Äôs Design at Scale Conference to product managers and designers on how and why to have hard conversations
- Showed fintech startups on how to unlock their creative thinking with a little more mindfulness and deep focus

I care deeply about bringing more mindfulness to your craft and more humanity to your relationships at every level‚ÄîI‚Äôm prepared to show you how that directly benefits your company, too.

In this workshop, you how to leverage healthy conflict with practical, equitable, non-prescriptive methods, and craft the best possible version of your product, your team, and even yourself.

## **Magical Cross-Functional Collaboration**

To build the best products and teams, it‚Äôs critical that you collaborate deeply with people both inside and outside your discipline to build a shared sense of ownership. This workshop focuses on building working agreements.

It identifies areas for you and your team to unlock the collaboration required to build top-tier products and break down silos you didn‚Äôt even know were there. Whether it‚Äôs someone who‚Äôs strongly-opinionated or extremely shy, you‚Äôll learn how to engage both‚Äîand everyone in between‚Äîfor a more meaningful collaboration.
