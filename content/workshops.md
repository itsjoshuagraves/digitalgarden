I offer half and full-day workshops that help teams unlock the secret to building great products: embracing healthy conflict and building psychological safety. We'll work together to craft plans tailored to your team's needs.

Since beginning my speaking career, I've:

- Talked with web3 engineers at ETHDenver on why they should care about design
- Given a masterclass at Rosenfeld’s Design at Scale Conference to product managers and designers on how and why to have hard conversations
- Showed fintech startups on how to unlock their creative thinking with a little more mindfulness and deep focus

I care deeply about bringing more mindfulness to your craft and more humanity to your relationships at every level—I’m prepared to show you how that directly benefits your company, too.

## Current Offerings

I'm focused on teaching teams how and why to embrace healthy conflict.

I offer customized workshops, both in-person or remote, and talks for your teams, too! Just [get in touch](https://www.joshuamauldin.com/contact) and we can discuss what you need.

### We Need to Talk

For most of us, conflict is often something we try to avoid. Yet, truly embracing “healthy” conflict is your team’s secret to building great products.

In this workshop, you how to leverage healthy conflict with practical, equitable, non-prescriptive methods, and craft the best possible version of your product, your team, and even yourself. Through exercises, worksheets, and facilitated discussion, you'll leave with tools you can put to use in your next hard conversation.

Available as:

- 4 hour workshop with one-on-one office hours available afterwards (4+ people required)
- 8 hour workshop with one-on-one office hours available afterwards (8+ people required)

### Magical Cross-Functional Collaboration

To build the best products and teams, it’s critical that you collaborate deeply with people both inside and outside your discipline to build a shared sense of ownership. This workshop focuses on building working agreements.

It identifies areas for you and your team to unlock the collaboration required to build top-tier products and break down silos you didn’t even know were there. Whether it’s someone who’s strongly-opinionated or extremely shy, you’ll learn how to engage both—and everyone in between—for a more meaningful collaboration.

- 45 minute talk with Q&A and one-on-one office hours afterwards
- 2 hour workshop with one-on-one office hours available afterwards
