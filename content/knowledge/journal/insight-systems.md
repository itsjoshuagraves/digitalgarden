I'm interested in how people try to make sense and gain insight about themselves, their lives and the world around them via outside patterns. Tarot and astrology are certainly two of the most accessible ways of doing that, but other things such as I Ching, palmistry, and other folk beliefs hold fascination.

Is this stuff real, you wonder? Who knows, I suppose it is if you believe it to be so. That doesn't interest me so much as how the act of focusing on these systems elicits insight about a particular part of your life. 

Say you are looking to make a big move in life, but are stuck on what to do. What if you pulled a Tarot card and thought about it for a moment? Maybe you spot something unexpected on it—a look on someone's face, a detail—that sparks a new approach to your question. Maybe that leads to the insight you needed.

That such tangential thinking can help you sidle up to a real solution that might've been eluding you is really the notion which holds my attention.

But also, they're fun.

## Scapulimancy

After watching [The Story of China](https://www.pbs.org/video/discovery-first-chinese-writing-0nuw50/) to fill some gaps in my world history knowledge, I caught a segment on reading "dragon bones." This is actually how historians uncovered the earliest form writing in China: they found burned animal bones with characters scratched onto them from the Shang Dynasty.

In this method of divination, holes were burned in one side of a bone with the intent to fracture the other side and give the reader an answer to a question. Questions like "will it rain" or "will our enemies attack" were common.
