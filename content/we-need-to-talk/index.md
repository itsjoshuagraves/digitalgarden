## FAQ

These common questions and their short answers are taken from We Need to Talk. You can find longer answers to each in your copy of the book, either printed or digital version.

### Will this book give me scripts to follow for tough conversations?
No. There are no rigid scripts here (they never work in real life any-way). Instead, you’ll get a flexible framework and practical tools you can adapt to any situation. Think of it as building your own conversational toolbox rather than following someone else’s playbook.

### What if someone springs a tough conversation on me out of nowhere?
You don’t always get the luxury of preparation. Don’t worry—this book teaches you specific techniques for staying centered, asking the right questions, and keeping your cool when caught off guard.

### How do I deal with someone who gets defensive or emotional?
In short: psychological safety and redirection. You’ll learn practical ways to de-escalate tension and guide things back to productive territory.

### What happens when we just can’t see eye-to-eye?
Not every conversation will end in agreement, and that’s okay. What matters is finding a way forward while keeping the relationship intact.
