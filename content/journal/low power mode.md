We can't all take vacations or mental health days, but we can leverage an idea from phones to recharge and restore ourselves: low power mode. It isn't possible or even advisable go full speed all the time, much though we'd like. 

I wrote down what I'd do if I were in low power mode, which helped whenever I felt overwhelmed. If you're in the same position, try it out for yourself.

## Have to
- Go to work
- Clean myself
- Sleep
- Water
- Be there for my people (at home)
- Meet deadlines

## Nice to do
- Stretch
- Meditate
- Eat healthy food
- Take a walk over lunch
- Be there for my people (at work)

## It isn't
- Do extra things that don't directly relate to your requirements

## It _definitely_ isn't
- Check your email or work comms after hours
