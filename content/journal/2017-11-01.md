In 2017/2018, I began to really think longer term. What this did was propel me into a director role, help me launch a book, and get a grip on my anxiety.

## Guiding Principles
- I provide my own validation by living according to my principles, it does not come from others
- I am unafraid of speaking up and challenging others
- I am not responsible for other people’s emotions
- I’m aware of what people are feeling but it doesn’t control me and I don’t take it personally
- I don’t let what others think control me or influence me
- I seek out wisdom and the building of a better self
- I understand the value of self care and prioritize it
- Job security is an illusion, any job can end at any time. Always have a plan.
