## Intuition vs temptation
Someone told me recently that they were tempted to move out of their current apartment and into another spot. Tempted. That word stuck with me, as I’ve been on a mission to really let my intuition have a voice in how I decide things. And I made a few connections in my mind about how those two overlap.

Intuition is so easily quieted by logic, others’ opinions, fear, and norms. It takes a lot to do something that might go against the grain. 


Thoughts we have can’t always be trusted. We second guess. We overanalyze. We think too much about it.

I think temptation is often intuition trying to talk to us in a way that makes us process the thought differently than we normally would. Specifically, making sure we don’t do that thing where we tell ourselves stories about the situation.
