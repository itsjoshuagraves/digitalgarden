It’s so damned easy to find a service that will take your money and create a website for you, or use a cloud to host your project. But with ease comes trade-offs. Namely, creativity and self-reliance.

When we use these tools, our expression and creativity become constrained by how the makers of the services crafted their tools. The medium shapes the message, as Marshall Mccluen said. And there’s usually little flexibility around that, as those makers (justifiably) have a vision to achieve and letting others tamper with that doesn’t jibe well with said vision. 

The other loss is self-reliance. What happens if we forget how to make these digital things ourselves, the places we go for knowledge aren’t reliable or reachable, or an internet isn’t available?

I don’t mean to imply everything will crash. That’s always possible, but what I’m saying is that I want to preserve the ability to craft and understand these technologies ourselves.

## Search
Can I make my own search engine?  https://wiby.me/ seems cool. 

## Hosting
I’ve used Nextcloud to make my own platform-agnostic cloud, which was great. I’d like to look more into this and host things on a raspberry pi and have it be powered by solar. Maybe I start with a local version on an old Mac mini. 

## Offline Knowledge
An ideal for me would be to carry a USB stick that contains all the offline knowledge I’d want. Like Wikipedia, repair guides, and things I like. It would contain a little server that let me use it, no matter where I plugged in. 

I’m looking into it presently with [Kiwix](kiwix.org) and may use a [waterproof USB stick](https://www.gorilladriveusb.com) to store it. 

## Personal LLM

I’d also like a personal LLM that would search my knowledge and notes, provide provocative questions, and fulfill what I see as the role of ultimate personal assistant.
