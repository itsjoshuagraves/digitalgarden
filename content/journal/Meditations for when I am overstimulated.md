We have three selves. The emotional, intellectual, and action self. 

When we are in a particularly intense period, maybe after a trip, visit, or metaphysical experience, try this. 

- Visualize yourself as a tree. Grow roots. Take many deep breaths during each of the following. 
- Your emotions release into the earth, to be reborn into something new. The earth can take it, this is natural. 
- Your thoughts release into the air, to be recycled into something new. This, too is natural. 
- As the emotions and thoughts begin to go back into the upper and lower worlds, your calmer action self emerges and can be fully in its body and present moment.
