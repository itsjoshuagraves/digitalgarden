## Thinking
- Designing and problem solving is [orienteering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orienteering). There’s no trail, there’s no map. It’s just you being dropped in a thick forest with only your compass and tools to help you find your way out.
- The more you cling to process, the quicker you sink.
- What you are now is the result of what you were. What you will be tomorrow will be the result of what you are now. 
- If you're stumped, leave it to your unconscious mind to untangle. Take a nap. Have a walk.
- Everything exists on a spectrum. And sometimes the spectrum is a circle. 

## Focus
- You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it.
- If everything is important, nothing is.
- Deliberate practice cannot exist alongside distraction.

## Ethics
- You have to be responsible for what you put into the world.
- Less 'move fast and break things,' more 'move slowly and fix things.'
