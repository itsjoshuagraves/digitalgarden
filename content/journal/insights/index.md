## Design & Thinking
What defines good design? Entire books are written and courses taught on the subject. Most of them are prescriptions for rigorous processes which don't map to any reality or cute lists and thought pieces which have no application to real life. Almost none are framed in terms that are accessible to anyone, which is a shame.

Instead, let me offer a practical definition that is accessible to anyone. 

First, let's define design. Is it making an interface? Yes. What about an object? Also yes. Doesn't it require training? Sometimes, but not really. Don't you have to be creative to design? Absolutely not. 

So what is it then?

Design is this: a practice and a mindset focused on solving a problem. That's it. If you have a problem and you make something to fix it, you have practiced design.

Now that you are free from the cloud of uncertainty, what is _good_ design? It's taking that mindset and realizing that not all problems have the same solution, even though they might look like it. Again, that's it.

## Thinking
- Problem solving is like [orienteering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orienteering). There’s no trail, there’s no map. It’s just you being dropped in a thick forest with only your compass and tools to help you find your way out.

## Practice
- The more you cling to process, the quicker you sink.
- What you are now is the result of what you were. What you will be tomorrow will be the result of what you are now. 
- If you're stumped, leave it to your unconscious mind to untangle. Take a nap. Have a walk.
- Everything exists on a spectrum. And sometimes the spectrum is a circle. 

## Focus
- You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it.
- If everything is important, nothing is.
- Deliberate practice cannot exist alongside distraction.

## Ethics
- You have to be responsible for what you put into the world.
- Less 'move fast and break things,' more 'move slowly and fix things.'
