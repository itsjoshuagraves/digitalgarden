We can't all take vacations or mental health days, but we can leverage an idea from phones to recharge and restore ourselves: low power mode. We can't go full speed all the time, much though we'd like. Here's what my essentials were, and I found it helpful to define what things weren't, too.

Have to:
- Going to work
- Cleaning yourself
- Sleep
- Water
- Being there for your people
- Meet deadlines

Nice to do:
- Stretching
- Meditation
- Healthy food
- Take a walk over lunch

It isn't:
- Doing extra on things that don't directly relate to your requirements

It definitely isn't:
- Checking your email or work comms after hours
