## Design
- Design is [orienteering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orienteering). There’s no trail, there’s no map. It’s just you being dropped in a thick forest with only your compass and tools to help you find your way out.
- The more you cling to process, the quicker you sink.

<!-- ## Human Interaction

> You can observe a lot by just watching.\

## Mind

* What you are now is the result of what you were. What you will be tomorrow will be the result of what you are now. 
* If you're stumped, leave it to your unconscious mind to untangle. Take a nap. Have a walk.
* Everything exists on a spectrum. And sometimes the spectrum is a circle.

> We hope to find meaning by fitting ourselves into some ready-made story about the universe, but according to the liberal interpretation of the world, the truth is exactly the opposite. The universe does not give me meaning. I give meaning to the universe. This is my cosmic vocation. I have no fixed destiny or dharma.\

## Focus

- You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it.
- If everything is important, nothing is.
- Deliberate practice cannot exist alongside distraction.

## Tech

- You have to be responsible for what you put into the world.
- Less 'move fast and break things,' more 'move slowly and fix things.'

> In order to cope with the unprecedented technological and economic disruptions of the twenty-first century, we need to develop new social and economic models as soon as possible. These models should be guided by the principle of protecting humans rather than jobs.\
