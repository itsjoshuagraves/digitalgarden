- Kindness and niceness are not the same thing. Kindness leads to honesty and flourishing whereas niceness leads to ruin.
- Boundaries aren't what you can't do, it's what I won't stand for.
- If you want to get inspired in what you're doing, look at what people outside of your area are doing. You can't come up with novel solutions if everything's self-referential.
