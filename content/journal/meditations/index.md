Remember we have three selves: the emotional, intellectual, and action self.

When we are in a particularly intense period, perhaps after a trip, visit, or tough day, try this. 

- Visualize yourself as a tree. Grow roots. Take many deep breaths during each of the following:
	- Think about your emotions. Visualize them as they release into the earth, to be reborn into something new. The earth can take it, this is natural. 
	- Consider your thoughts, their immensity. Visualize them as they release up into the air and float onward to be recycled into something new. This, too is natural.
	- As the emotions and thoughts begin clear, check in with your body from crown to toe. Feel a calmer self emerge, one that is able to be fully in its body and present moment.
