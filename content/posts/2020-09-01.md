- What got you here won’t take you there. Always be learning and question your assumptions. Especially those that seem foundational.
- You’re probably already thinking like a leader. It’s all about seeing the bigger picture.
- Don’t do this if your goal is power or influence. You can have those without the weight of leadership. Too many ppl in management shouldn’t be there.
- Have a 90-day plan. It can be broad. Think about your principles. Live them out.
-  Hire people fast.
- Believe in your people. Your job is to get out of their way. Pick them up when they hit a wall, turn them around and let them go.
- Trust is not likeability. You won’t always ageee with your boss’ decisions but you can respect them. Trust is telling someone when it’s going badly.
- Journal. Get things out of your head. I spent months of sleepless nights because I kept thinking about work. It’s a big job to do, being a director. But if you can plan, write, and export things from your head you’ll be able to do better
- Related: get some sleep. Don’t overdo it. Late nights are okay once in a while, but you’ll turn into a nasty version of yourself if you don’t get enough sleep.
- Paddle your own canoe. Our mentors and those who came before us aren’t our masters, they’re guides. Find your own way.
