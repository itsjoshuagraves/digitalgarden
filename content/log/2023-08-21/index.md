## Tech
Lots more fun to be had on the LLM front. 

[Tavily](https://tavily.com/) might be helpful in other research. It's really my ideal use case for such a technology. In a similar vein, [GPT Researcher](https://github.com/assafelovic/gpt-researcher) seems like it might also fit the bill for unbiased (I hope) research.

[Quivr](https://github.com/StanGirard/quivr/) seems interesting, too, as it's promising to be a second brain. If it's more useful than Spotlight, I'll be interested.

## Writing
More tech edits for [We Need to Talk](/we-need-to-talk). I'm getting closer. I got some in-depth feedback from more skilled mediators. It's good to know I'm worth my salt as a mediator, and I've still got room to grow.

## Misc weirdness
I saw some [old army report](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/20601195/6-full-report.pdf) someone got from a FOIA where they looked into astral projection, and the photo at the top is from one of those pages.
