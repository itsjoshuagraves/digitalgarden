Solo week. My wife was out shooting the first short that she wrote and directed. Iâ€™m so excited for her, and itâ€™s baffling how talented she, the cast and crew are. The stills I've seen look incredible. More on this when it's ready.

I spent a lot of this week looking into retro horror and mapping out a story I want to write. Then I spotted the VHS cover you see above. Coincidentally I found it on my wifeâ€™s birthday. Her name is Alison. ðŸ˜Š 

Misc thoughts:
- You canâ€™t trust what you donâ€™t test. 
- If youâ€™re fearing rejection, you can either risk it and try or guarantee it by not trying.
- There are two forms of rejection. The first is trying and failing, rejection is not guaranteed here. The second is doing nothing, which ensures rejection by default.
- Don't confuse the description of a thing with the thing itself. Maps aren't the terrain, menus aren't the meal.
