Did some reorganization to take advantage of Hugo's page bundles, which will make updates a little smoother and keep the site tidy. 

I'd wanted a workflow where I could easily copy/paste from my writing environment directly into Hugo but that proved a little too tricky to set up. 

## ePubs
Turns out, you can make ebooks out of markdown sites. So I turned [The Nevermore](https://nevermore.rip) into an ePub book! It took a lot of work to get how I wanted, but it's easy enough to do with [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/epub.html). I ended up moving over to a familiar favorite to finish it up, [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com). That let me add styling and everything I wanted. The interface isn't as easy for writing code, but has a certain "early 2000s" charm to it that I love.

These ePub files are basically giant zip files with `xhtml` powering them. So cool.
