Lost Horse partners with small businesses to create human-centered brands, websites, and software that speak directly to their audience, all powered by green, solar-hosted solutions.

After years of working with Fortune 100 companies, I’m shifting my focus to help those who refuse to settle for the ordinary. I’m building a better kind of company—one rooted in sustainability and long-term success. 

The team I work with brings top-tier, thoughtful, and holistic design to businesses of all sizes, without the overhead or hassle of traditional agencies. Lost Horse doesn’t just deliver a service—we are a long-term partner in success. We’re also creating an employee-owned company. This means every team member has a stake in the business and a shared commitment to our clients’ success.
