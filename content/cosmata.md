Cosmata is geometric sans serif family of 10 fonts suitable for both display and reading use. Inspired by Futura, Cosmata developed its own complex, unique life.

To that end, I've included alternate letterforms for a finely-tailored typographic experience. The rhythm, kerning, and spacing have been lovingly crafted for an elegant reading experience.

I'm excited to share this release with you and hope you enjoy using it as much as I did creating it.
