## [Visual Art](/art)
A selection of works. Mixed media collage, glitch art, music industry work, skulls (not real ones!), and tinkering with old tech. Lots of darker themes exploring identity, loneliness, memento moris.

## [Journal](/journal)
I'm intentionally not calling this a blog, as that comes with expectations of constant updates. Instead, this is a place to store thoughts on topics that matter to me.

## [Read & Watch List](/media)
I watch and read a lot. Here’s some of it.
