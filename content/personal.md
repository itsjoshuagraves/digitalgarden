## [Visual Art](/art)
Mixed media collages, glitch art and skulls (not real ones!). Lots of darker themes exploring identity, loneliness, memento moris. Also, tinkering.

## [Journal](/journal)
A place where collect thoughts on topics that matter to me. (I'm intentionally not calling this a blog, as that comes with expectations of constant updates.)

## [Read & Watch List](/media)
I watch and read a lot. Here’s some of it.
