## Current Offerings

Right now, I’m focused on speaking engagements and workshops directly tied to my book, [We Need to Talk](/we-need-to-talk).

Most teams see conflict as something to avoid. The best teams use it as a tool for growth. Learning how to embrace “healthy” conflict—without defensiveness, frustration, or avoidance—is the key to building better products, stronger teams, and a more effective version of yourself.

In this workshop, you’ll learn how to:
- Navigate hard conversations without escalation
- Use practical, equitable, and non-prescriptive methods to resolve tension
- Create a culture where feedback flows freely and teams thrive

Through hands-on exercises, worksheets, and guided discussions, you’ll walk away with tools you can use in your very next conversation.

### Workshop Formats
- Half-day (4 hours) – Includes optional one-on-one office hours (4+ participants)
- Full-day (8 hours) – Includes optional one-on-one office hours (8+ participants)
