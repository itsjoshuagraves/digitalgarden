{{< tab "Good Stuff" >}}

You shouldn't ever _just_ read design books. Good designers are clear thinkers and sharp observers who can succinctly define a problem. 

The best examples of such come from outside sources, as true creativity can’t come from being entirely self-referential.

## [No Tech Magazine](https://www.notechmagazine.com)
Seeing how people solve problems with little or no tech can inspire you to look at the tech you have in new ways.
