## About the Role
Some info about what success looks like, the kinds of things we’re looking for

## Intro/what we want (10 min)
1. Someone who’s a good communicator, good facilitator, and doesn’t mind not knowing the answer.
2. You should be very comfortable negotiating between business objectives and user needs.
3. You’ll want to be able to show me how you work, what matters to you, and how you manage being resilient in a project.

## Warm up
1. Icebreaker question

## Portfolio Review (30 min)
Have them walk through one to two projects which demonstrate two things:
1. Their personal aesthetic.
2. Their best design thinking.
	a. This can be for mobile, b2c, or b2b.

We prefer to see working software and working files.

### Here’s what we’re looking for in the presentation

- How clear is the narrative in their presentation?
- What goals did they establish? Did they meet them?
- How thoughtful and detailed are their visual designs?
- How did they know they were solving the right problem?
- What accessibility considerations did they make when designing?
- Did they talk to the people who will use what they designed? What was the process like?
- What was the biggest challenge with this?
- If they could go back and do it again, what would they do differently?

### Process and Experience
1. Describe your process as a designer. What’s most exciting to you?
