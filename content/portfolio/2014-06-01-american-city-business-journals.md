## Role
From 2012–2015, I worked with this team for 3 years and grew to lead the interaction design for 3 iOS app releases. I also led our team's move to a responsive design for each of their 43 different properties. My work involved working directly with stakeholders, developers, researchers. I also conducted usability studies.
