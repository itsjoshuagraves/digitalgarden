## Role
From 2012–2015, I worked with this team for 3 years and grew to lead the interaction design for 3 iOS app releases. I also led our team's move to a responsive design for each of their 43 different properties. My work involved working directly with stakeholders, developers, researchers. I also conducted usability studies.

I was also challenged to increase signups and app usage, so I presented a concept that integrated personalized news that the business’ technology could support.

## Key Accomplishments

- Turned a 1-star app into a 4.5-star app.
- Updated our design process to move away from static images and towards working prototypes and a more iterative approach.A pattern library and early design system.
